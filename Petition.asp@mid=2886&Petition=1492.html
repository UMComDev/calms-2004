<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >The biblical mandate &ldquo;to love the sojourner&rdquo; is not a matter of choice but rather a debt we owe to the God who brought our liberation, the guarantor of our freedom. When the scripture calls us not to mistreat the immigrant (Exodus 22:21), it is not alluding to some kind of choice for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not about deciding if we are going to love the immigrant or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;People of faith, God&rsquo;s children have no choice. The biblical witness sustains that we were once immigrants ourselves in the land of Egypt (Exodus 23:9), therefore, we must love our neighbor as we love ourselves (Leviticus 19:18 and Matthew 19:19).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In 2001 President George W. Bush signed into law Public Law 107-56, to Provide Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, better known as the PATRIOT Act. This law was passed after the aftermath of September 11th, 2001. The bill went through Congress with no debate, and very little was known about it. According to the supporters of this legislation, this law sought to provide the Federal government with the authority to track and intercept both criminal and foreign intelligence communications. The argument of the supporters has been that the law will strengthen the government's ability to combat money laundering by extending the Treasury Secretary's authority and defining new crimes and penalties. Additionally, the law was designed to ban foreign terrorists from the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> This act creates a new crime, "domestic terrorism," so broadly defined that it could conceivably apply to acts of civil disobedience. The USA PATRIOT Act gives the FBI&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> and the CIA greater rights to wiretap phones, monitor e-mail, survey medical, financial and student records, and break into homes and offices without prior notification. It creates a new crime of domestic terrorism that is so broadly defined that it may be applied to citizens acting legally to express their dissent. Under this Act and other legislation, noncitizens are being deported or detained indefinitely without judicial appeal. <br> The dangers of the USA PATRIOT Act are augmented by a Bureau of Prisons order allowing federal agents to abridge the attorney-client privilege by eavesdropping on conversations between lawyers and their clients held in federal custody. The Justice Department has also dismantled regulations against COINTELPRO operations that were enacted following abuses of the civil rights and peace movements of the 50's, 60's and 70's. The Administration has ordered secret military tribunals for suspected terrorists. <br> In addition to being unfair and unnecessary, the U.S. threat of using military tribunals increases the likelihood that U.S. citizens will be treated accordingly overseas, and decreases the likelihood that other governments will be willing to extradite suspected terrorists or other parties wanted by the U.S. <br> Under the guise of this law, and the war on terrorism, some states have taken steps to purge their territory of undocumented immigrants. These activities are not limited to Arab foreigners, but rather, it is open to anyone whom the state police considers a foreigner.&nbsp;&nbsp;This clearly shows that in some states the police considers that getting rid of undocumented immigrants is a higher goal than community safety and trust. <br> In parts of the Southeast, state police has arrested pastors for transporting members of their congregations to Sunday worship, they have been stopped and charged with trafficking undocumented immigrants and those in their cars who were undocumented have been deported. In another case the police waited outside of the church for the service to be over and as people were coming out of the church they were detained and deported. Over half of the congregation has been deported. These persons deported were members of our United Methodist Church, they are our brothers and sisters. These persons deported have attended Walk to Emmaus&rsquo;s retreats, Annual Conferences, and have shared the Lord&rsquo;s table with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> A legislation that seeks to make the above experience a permanent reality is the Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien Removal Act (also known as the CLEAR Act), introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-GA). This bill seeks to withhold funds from state and local law enforcement agencies that do not agree to enforce immigration laws. It would reward those state and local police agencies that do help round up undocumented immigrants a share of fines and forfeited property and financial assistance for equipment, technology and facilities to incarcerate detainees as well as personal and agency immunity for any claim arising out of the enforcement of immigration law. If passed, the CLEAR Act would undermine community policing, and prevent immigrants from coming forward to report crime. <br> The immigrant scare that is now running rampant in our midst is reminiscent of past experiences of civil right violations during the Communist scared of the 1940s and 1950s.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Then we were looking for communists now we are looking for terrorist. For some police departments this seems to translate into anyone with dark skin and a heavy accent. Latinos constituted great targets in this contemporary version of the &ldquo;witch-hunt.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In 1948 the Bishops of the Church expressed clearly what was at stake. The insidious danger of seeking to defend liberty with incompatible means was tellingly scored by the Council. &ldquo;In an hour when total totalitarianism threatens freedom, it is imperative that we ourselves do not adopt the practices of the totalitarian state in order to destroy the totalitarian threat. The totalitarian has conquered when the defender of democracy has discarded the civil liberties that are the essence of democracy.&rdquo; In the same way the Board of Social and Economic Relations of the Methodist Church, expressed this concern eloquently: &ldquo;To violate civil liberties in order to combat Communism is to use an evil means to try to bring about a good end, and history shows that means and ends are inevitably interrelated.&rdquo;<br> The fact of the matter is that the attacks on our immigrant brothers and sisters in The United Methodist Church is the result of&nbsp;&nbsp;myopic perspective of society and history.&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack on our immigrant population be it documented or not is an affront to our Church&rsquo;s principles of inclusiveness and openness. Our fellow United Methodists are suffering because they are being racially profiled, sought after by the police for deportation for the alleged crime of being here illegally. <br> Therefore, be it resolved that The United Methodist Church calls on Congress to stop the immigrant &ldquo;witch-hunt&rdquo; started by some police departments in the Southeast part of the United States. <br> Be it further resolved, that the 2004 General Conference of the United Methodist Church request the Justice Department and the U.S. Congress to respect places of worship and allow all persons to exercise their religious freedom. <br> Be it further resolved that the Council of Bishops on behalf of the United Methodist Church seeks counsel and provide guidance to pastors and congregations working with immigrants on how to protect their rights. <br> Be it further resolved that the United Methodist Church, through the General Board of Church and Society, work with members of Congress and religious and civil rights organizations to repeal of the PATRIOT Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be sent to the President of the United States and to members of Congress. <br> </font></b></b><b></b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
