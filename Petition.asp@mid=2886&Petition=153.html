<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Amend ¶¶164G & 165C as follows: <br> <font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">� 164 G) Military Service</i>-<strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">We deplore war and urge the peaceful settlement of all disputes among nations. From the beginning, the Christian conscience has struggled with the harsh realities of violence and war, for these evils clearly frustrate God&rsquo;s loving purposes for humankind. We yearn for the day when there will be no more war and people will live together in peace and justice. Some of us believe that war, and other acts of violence, are never acceptable to Christians. We also acknowledge that most Christians regretfully realize that, when peaceful alternatives have failed, the force of arms may be preferable to unchecked aggression, tyranny and genocide. We honor the witness of pacifists who will not allow us to become complacent about war and violence. We also respect those who support the use of force, but only in extreme situations and only when the need is clear beyond reasonable doubt, and through appropriate international organizations. We urge the establishment of the rule of law in international affairs as a means of elimination of war, violence, and coercion in these affairs. <br> </strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">We reject national policies of enforced military service as incompatible with the gospel. We acknowledge the agonizing tension created by the demand for military service by national governments. <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">(See �165C)&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">We urge all young adults to seek the counsel of the Church as they reach a conscientious decision concerning the nature of their responsibility as citizens. Pastors are called upon to be available for counseling with all young adults who face conscription, including those who conscientiously refuse to cooperate with a system of conscription. <br> We support and extend the ministry of the Church to those persons who conscientiously oppose all war, or any particular war, and who therefore refuse to serve in the armed forces or to cooperate with systems of military conscription. We also support and extend the Church&rsquo;s ministry to those persons who conscientiously choose to serve in the armed forces or to accept alternative service. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>� 165 C) War and Peace</i>-We believe war is incompatible with the teachings and example of Christ. <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">We deplore war and urge the peaceful settlement of all disputes among nations. From the beginning, the Christian conscience has struggled with the harsh realities of violence and war, for these evils clearly frustrate God&rsquo;s loving purposes for humankind.

We honor the witness of pacifists who will not allow us to become complacent about war and violence. We also respect those who support the use of force, but only in extreme situations and only when the need is clear beyond reasonable doubt, and through appropriate international organizations. We affirm the principles of Just War Theory (proper authority, just causes, right intention, last resort, reasonable hope of success, discrimination, and proportion) as the minimum guide for decisions on the moral use of force.&nbsp;&nbsp;We urge the establishment of the rule of law in international affairs as a means of elimination of war, violence, and coercion in these affairs. <br> </b><font FACE="Times New Roman">We therefore reject war as a usual instrument of national foreign policy and insist that the first moral duty of all nations is to resolve by peaceful means every dispute that arises between or among them; that human values must outweigh military claims as governments determine their priorities; that the militarization of society must be challenged and stopped; that the manufacture, sale, and deployment of armaments must be reduced and controlled; and that the production, possession, or use of nuclear weapons be condemned.<b> </b>Consequently, we endorse general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. <br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
