<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >During the 2001-2004 quadrennium, the General Board of Global Ministries, in consultation with the National Federation of Asian American United Methodists (NFAAUM), established a task force to fulfill the mandate of the 2000 General Conference regarding the Asian American Language Ministry Study. The task force consisted of two representatives from each of the ten sub-ethnic caucuses of the Asian American United Methodist community who were elected by their own ethnic caucuses. Staff with responsibilities for racial ethnic concerns and ministries on behalf of program boards and agencies were also invited as resource persons.&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary tasks for the Asian American Language Ministry Study Task Force were to: (1) research and study the needs in Asian American communities; (2) develop recommendations to address these needs; and (3) establish priorities for the funding of programs that would begin to develop ministries in communities that would reach Asian Americans (see full report elsewhere in the ADCA). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Findings</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Through this research and study, members of the task force developed the following findings that would help The United Methodist Church to develop ministries that would address the needs in Asian American communities: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an urgent need to develop new ministries, fellowships and congregations. With sufficient resources and support, The United Methodist Church could begin 50 new Asian American congregations, ministries and fellowships in the 2005-2008 Quadrennium. This could be done with the joint effort of the general agencies, annual conferences, districts and others. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a shortage of leadership to supply the ministries that are currently in existence. There is an urgent need to begin recruiting and training leadership-ordained clergy, local pastors, lay missioners, lay speakers, etc.-to provide leadership for the current and new ministries. Approximately 100-150 new leaders will be needed to serve the current and new ministries. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;As new ministries are developed, leadership training will need to be developed for both laywomen and laymen. It will need to be language specific so that those being trained are better able to understand the messages being conveyed. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is extremely important in Asian American immigrant communities; yet, there are few United Methodist campus ministries that reach young people of college age. Many of the young people in the churches do not return after college. While in college they are reached by Campus Crusade and Intervarsity, both of which are highly organized to reach Asian American students. There is a need to develop strong ministries on many key campuses where there is a large Asian American enrollment. <br> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Resource material that is language specific for the newer immigrant community is vitally important. New language resources would include evangelism material, Sunday School material, leadership development material, stewardship material, hymnals, and other United Methodist resources. Currently, material in the Korean language has been developed to reach the Korean community. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;These new ministries are also in need of leadership that works with them in addressing the needs in the community. Training and the use of community developers needs to be an important component of reaching out to the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Common Needs and Strategies</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The Asian American Language Ministry Study Task Force, in conjunction with the National Federation of Asian American United Methodists (NFAAUM) and the General Board of Global Ministries, makes the following recommendations for the 2005-2008 quadrennium: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Development of New Congregations</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The sub-ethnic caucuses are prepared to work with districts, annual conferences, and the General Board of Global Ministries in establishing new congregations/ministries/fellowships. There is an urgency to reach the new immigrant communities where there are no United Methodist language ministries in existence. Studies have been conducted by the sub-ethnic groups to determine the strategic placement of these new congregations/ministries/fellowships. Support is needed in order to develop strong ministries. The cost of developing the number of new congregations for which there is a potential is larger than there are funds available in any one place in the church. Nonetheless, through the cooperative efforts of all of these groups, strong vital congregations can be developed. Sub-ethnic groups will be asked to provide suggested ways that the development of these congregations may be accomplished. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Recruitment and Training of Pastoral and Lay Leadership</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In order to develop these new congregations, one of the most pressing needs for Asian American United Methodists is the recruitment and training of language ministers. With the exception of the Korean American United Methodist community, where there are an ample supply of language speaking clergy, Asian American churches are in dire need of ministers who can speak the native tongue of new immigrants. A number of diverse ministers fluent in different languages (such as Mandarin, Cantonese, Amoy/Taiwanese, Tagalog, Ilocano, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, Urdu, Hindi, Gujarati, Telugu, Tamil, and/or Japanese) are needed to serve these&nbsp;&nbsp;congregations. <br> There is also a need to provide adequate training for the leadership in these communities. Many of the existing churches are served by local pastors. These local pastors need to be provided with adequate training in order to serve their churches and develop new congregations. Also, until more persons are trained for the ordained ministry, there is a need to provide training for lay persons who can serve churches on a voluntary basis. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Development of Community Ministries</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Immigrant congregations have a different sociological dynamic. The immigrant churches are and can be important vehicles to transmit one&rsquo;s own cultural heritage to the following generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The immigrant churches are not only faith communities, but they function in our society as a place where meaningful programs and activities take place. Cultural activities, language schools, after school programs, tutoring programs, citizenship classes and social welfare programs for new immigrants are carried out by these faith communities. Immigrant churches are most suited to strengthen outreach ministries and family ministries, and they provide an important social organization in the immigrant community. Local immigrant congregations play a vital role in the immigrant community by providing these services. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Development of Language Resources and Materials</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In order for language ministries to be effective and successful, adequate language resources need to be developed. Materials from the native countries of specific language groups do not reflect the social settings in the United States and are, consequently, not useful for congregations in the U.S. Asian American churches find that they need to develop their own resource materials in order to adequately cover and support their ministry. Worship resources, such as hymnals and liturgies, are needed. The material must be user-friendly to the Asian American. Sunday School material developed in one&rsquo;s own language with examples that are familiar are important. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Summary of Needs and Recommendations for Implementation</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The Asian American community is one of the fastest growing communities in the United States. There is an urgent need to support this diverse community by providing the resources that will help to make the development of these congregations and ministries effective. With ten language groups, developing new congregations and ministries is more complex than developing the same with single language groups. No one agency can provide the support that is needed in order to develop these new congregations, train new leadership, develop outreach ministries and new resource materials. It will take collaborative efforts on the part of all levels of the church. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Therefore, it is recommended that a committee be established to implement the Asian American Language Ministry Study. It is further recommended that: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 1. The committee be composed of the following persons/categories: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty Asian American sub-ethnic caucus members (selected by the caucuses) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One GBGM staff from the Asian American Ministries office <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >One staff from each of the other general agencies of The UMC with specific relationship to racial/ethnic or Asian American ministries <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One staff from the National Federation of Asian American United Methodists <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other persons as needed (to be determined by the committee) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 2. The committee meet twice annually to (1) determine the ministries that will be developed for that current year; (2) recommend funding for new or continuing projects; (3) develop guidelines/understandings for the use of the funds; (4) develop reports on the ministries that are in process; (5) evaluate projects funded; (6) recommend changes in order to accomplish the work; (6) work in supporting each other&rsquo;s work; and (7) develop recommendations for the following quadrennium. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 3. Administrative oversight of the program be assigned to the General Board of Global Ministries. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 4. Annual conferences be encouraged to participate in the development of the new ministries. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <u><b>Proposed Quadrennial Budget</u></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Annual Program Expenses</b><br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >New Congregational Development&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $180,000 <br> Community Development&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70,000 <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leadership Development&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70,000 <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laymen, Laywomen, Youth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $40,000 <br> Ministerial&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30,000 <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resource Development&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60,000 <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worship Resources&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20,000 <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Educational Resources&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40,000 <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Program Support Services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 75,000 <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30,000 <br> Consultant Services &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 45,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><br> </u><br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual Total</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$455,000</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> It is recommended that <b>quadrennial funding of $1,820,000 </b>be approved to support the development of new congregations; new leadership, including training; community ministries; and language resources for Asian American communities. <br> </font></b></b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
