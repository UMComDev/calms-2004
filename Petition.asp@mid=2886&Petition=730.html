<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >As we move into the second quadrennium of a new millennium, we believe the call of God continues to challenge us to embrace ministries with Hispanic/Latino people in an intentional and systematic way. Such ministries include hospitality, evangelism, service, social justice, and outreach. <br> <br> <b> VISION <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b>The National Plan for Hispanic Ministry reaffirms the vision which has guided it from the beginning:<i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Ours is a vision of a church in which, as in the first Pentecost, all can hear of the mighty works of God in their own tongue </i>(Acts 2:8)<i> - which is not merely a matter of language, but also of cultural identity, family traditions, etc. At Pentecost, the Holy Spirit did not destroy or ignore the cultural identity of those present, but rather made the Gospel available to them in whatever language they spoke. This led the early church to new life and new growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise in the church today, we must find ways to affirm the various cultural identities of those among whom we witness.&nbsp;&nbsp;And they in turn must be encouraged to speak of the mighty works of God &ldquo;in their own tongue.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Ours is a vision of a dynamic and growing church, joyously sharing and living the good News of Jesus Christ in a multiplicity of places, urban and rural, in congregations large and small, and in a variety of cultural settings. In this church, groups which traditionally have been disenfranchised will be full partners in Christ&rsquo;s ministry, and the gifts of every Hispanic - male and female, young and old, factory worker and professional, immigrant and native - will be put to use for the up building of the entire body. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In this vision, United Methodist congregations - both Hispanic... and others - will be profoundly and actively committed to an understanding of mission grounded on the connection between church growth and service to the community, between witness by word and witness by action, between evangelism and advocacy. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this vision, an increased Hispanic presence and active participation would be&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> an asset for The United Methodist Church, not only in terms of added numbers,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> but also in terms of the gifts Hispanics bring to our denomination - gifts born out&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> of a long history of struggle and suffering through which faith has been proven&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> and revitalized.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b></i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></ul></ul></ul></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >NAME <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b>During the 2001-2004 quadrennium, the church has come to recognize that the term &ldquo;Hispanic&rdquo; does not fully embrace the multi-cultural, multi-lingual and diverse nature of the community it seeks and/or has opportunity to serve. This has been most visibly expressed in our relationships and interactions with the Brazilian (Portuguese speaking) churches/communities in the United States. In order to be faithful to the inclusive nature of the need and the vision which gave birth to The National Plan, it is recommended that, henceforth, what was previously known as The National Plan for Hispanic Ministry be officially renamed <b><i>The National Plan for Hispanic/Latino Ministry. <br> </i><br> GOALS&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </b><br> The National Committee set forth the following goals for the 2005-2008 quadrennium.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some are continuing goals, some are a revision/expansion of existing goals, and some are new goals based on changing realities. Special attention will be given to inter-generational, multi-cultural/multi-lingual, and ministries with women and children: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Continuing Goals for 2005-2008 <br>  <ul><li></b>Resource the development of 100 Hispanic/Latino new congregations. </li></li><br><li>Resource the strengthening of 100 Hispanic/Latino congregations.<br> <b> </b><li>Identify persons and placement opportunities for a total of 50 missionaries.<br> <b>  <li>Revised/Expanded Goals for 2005-2008 </li></li><br><li></b>Provide grants to 30 annual conferences for the implementation of the National Plan for Hispanic/Latino Ministry. </li></li><br><li>Resource the development of 500 Hispanic/Latino faith communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b> </b><li>Provide training for 800 Hispanic/Latino lay missioners. </li></li><br><li>Resource the recruitment and training of Hispanic/Latino pastoral leadership. </li></li><br><li>Resource the development of 300 Church School Extensions. </li></li><br><li>Resource 1000 local churches or regional groups to be involved in justice and outreach ministries. </li></li><br><li><b>New Goals for 2005-2008 </li></li><br><li></b>Resource the development of ministry with Brazilians within the context of the National Plan. </li></li><br><li>Provide training for 1500 Hispanic/Latino lay persons for mission and ministry. </li></li><br><li>Resource 500 non-Hispanic/Latino congregations in ministry with Hispanic/Latino communities. </li></li><br><li>Resource the annual conferences&rsquo; committees on Hispanic/Latino ministries. </li></li><br><li>Resource at least 30 annual conferences as they continue implementing or developing comprehensive leadership formation programs for Hispanic/Latino ministries.<br> <b>  <li></li></li><br><li>EMPOWERING AND EQUIPPING THE WHOLE CHURCH:</b><br> </li></li><br><li>Although in past quadrennia much of the emphasis has been on empowering the Hispanic church, one need only re-read the vision of The Plan to see that it emphasizes the strengthening and empowering of the whole church. The methodology (See-Judge-Act) is one which can be used at any time and in any place to identify and shape a ministry that is responsive to the needs of any people. It needs to be made more visible across the whole church.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> <b><li>Mission Initiative Grants and &ldquo;Acompa&#241;amiento&rdquo;<br> </b><li> </li></li><br><li>It is the goal of The National Plan to continue to provide grants to annual conferences through the process of &ldquo;acompa&#241;amiento&rdquo; as a response to the ongoing requests for assistance in gathering and reviewing data, formulating strategic plans, and participating in ongoing assessment and review of ministries with Hispanic/Latino people. Past experience has shown that these grants enable the participating annual conferences to mobilize their own financial and human resources. <br> <br> <b><li>Conference Committees on Hispanic/Latino Ministries <br> </b><li> </li></li><br><li>While one of the goals of The National Plan is to empower the creation and strengthening of faith communities and local congregations, the annual conferences provide the context in which Hispanic/Latino ministries develop and grow strong, where leadership is discovered and developed, and where new opportunities for outreach and witness become evident. Therefore, The Plan calls on each annual conference to organize a Conference Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries (CCHM) or its equivalent, which will oversee the implementation of The National Plan for Hispanic/Latino Ministry within the conference in coordination with the office responsible for implementing The National Plan. It is recommended that this committee be composed of members representing local Hispanic/Latino ministries, district representatives in regions with significant Hispanic/Latino populations, and representatives from the cabinet and other appropriate conference agencies. The committee&rsquo;s membership should reflect the diversity of the conference. <br> </ul></li></li><br>  <br> </ul></li></li><br>  <br> <b><li>Local Congregations <br> </b><li> </li></li><br><li>The National Plan continues to affirm the understanding that mission begins at the local level.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, all congregations, Hispanic/Latino or non-Hispanic/Latino, are challenged to examine their communities, identify specific needs for ministry, and become centers of mission and evangelism with Hispanic/Latino people. Congregations that respond to identified needs can draw support from appropriate conference entities and assistance from the resources of the general agencies, including specific programs designed to help them as they mobilize for ministry. <br> </li></li><br><li><b><i>Mobilizing Non-Hispanic/Latino Local Churches for Hispanic/Latino Ministry</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></li><br><li></b></li></li><br><li>Non-Hispanic congregations are seeking assistance in identifying and developing ministries with Hispanic/Latino people.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still much unfinished work in this area and non-Hispanic/Latino churches have a very significant role in opening the doors of The United Methodist Church to all the people. A high priority for consultations, training events and the development of resources is placed on this goal for the 2005-2008 quadrennium. <br> </li></li><br><li><b><i>Revitalizing and Mobilizing Hispanic/Latino Local Churches</b><br> </li></li><br><li></i>Programs for mobilizing Hispanic/Latino local churches have been developed and tested by the General Board of Discipleship and the General Board of Global Ministries in the following conferences:&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida, Rio Grande, New York, and New Jersey. During the past quadrennium, persons were trained in each jurisdiction to assist local churches so that they may become centers of mission in their particular communities. The work has begun. Much remains to be done. It continues to be a high priority need in the 2005-2008 quadrennium. <br> </li></li><br><li><b>Ministries of Justice <br> </b><li> </li></li><br><li>Immigration of Hispanic/Latino persons to the U.S. is not only to urban centers where there is perceived possibility for employment but also to agricultural centers. Much of the employment available, however, is unskilled and low-income minimum wage. Unemployment, along with alcohol/drug abuse, crime, housing, HIV/AIDS and lack of access to health care and education, are prevalent. Often, these problems are compounded by language barriers and immigration policies. Holistic ministry with Hispanic/Latino people involves meeting their spiritual as well as their socio-economic/justice needs in urban settings. <br> </li></li><br><li>The National Committee for Hispanic/Latino Ministries envisions a strong and collaborative working relationship with general agencies like the General Board of Church and Society, the General Board of Global Ministries, and the General Commission on Religion and Race, and with ecumenical bodies in addressing ministries of justice for Hispanic/Latino people. In order to significantly impact local, state, and federal government laws/policies, it is critical that a concerted effort be made to address these issues by local churches, annual conferences and general boards.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i><li> <br> <b></i><li>MOBILIZING LEADERSHIP FOR MISSION <br> </li></li><br><li>Training Clergy Leaders <br> <br> </b><li>The need for trained Hispanic/Latino clergy has increased with the continued rapid growth of the Hispanic/Latino population, the changing demographics of Hispanic/Latino people within the United States, and the continued desire of churches to be in ministry with Hispanic/Latino people.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </li></li><br><li>A seminary degree is the desirable route for the theological education of most clergy.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is also recognized that the only option for a large number of Hispanic/Latino pastors in The United Methodist Church is the Course of Study. Many Hispanic/Latino pastors would pursue a BA degree as basic preparation for seminary if they had the encouragement, support, and financial resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </li></li><br><li>Continuing education for Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino ministers and local church leaders engaged in ministry with Hispanic/Latino people is provided by some seminaries, Hispanic regional training centers, and conference Institutes. There needs to be continued consultation around the Course of Study offered by seminaries so that Hispanic/Latino pastors are prepared to be effective in the communities in which they minister. Seminaries need to be challenged to prepare pastors to serve in Hispanic/Latino churches. <br> </li></li><br><li>The need for qualified leaders for Hispanic/Latino ministries is urgent. Therefore, it is important to continue providing, in collaboration with the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry, relevant programs and resources for leadership formation (i.e., mentoring programs to provide support and nurture to Hispanic/Latino students, teaching parish models, and recruitment for Hispanic/Latino students). </li></li><br><li>There is need for programs that will assist in the recruitment, nurture, and support of Hispanic/Latino seminary students. Some examples are retreats for UM seminary students to support, encourage and keep them in the ministerial track; resources to assist directors of admissions in their understanding of the culture of the call to ministry within the Hispanic/Latino community; and consultations with faculty teaching Courses of Study to provide greater coordination and collaboration between The Plan and the methodology of teaching. <br> <br> <b><li>Equipping Facilitator-Trainers <br> <br> </b><li>The formation of leaders has become critical as more conferences<b> </b>want to engage in ministries with Hispanic/Latino people. &ldquo;Training the trainers/facilitators&rdquo; is an important method for maximizing the resources of The National Plan. These trainers/facilitators make it possible to increase the numbers of lay and clergy, both Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino, who are available for ministries within Hispanic/Latino communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leadership formation continues to be a key component of the National Plan. It is envisioned that the Plan will continue to train lay and clergy leaders, both Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino, for ministries with Hispanics. <br> </li></li><br><li>The basic curriculum for the training of these persons will continue to be Module I and II.&nbsp;&nbsp;These modules continually need to be updated. In addition to Modules I and II, there are several new workshops which collectively comprise Module III, and there are more that need to be developed by various general agencies of the church. Persons who have been trained to implement and maintain the ministries under the auspices of The National Plan will continue to need educational and skill development opportunities focused on the uniqueness of their ministry. They will need spiritual, emotional, and physical support and renewal opportunities to sustain them in the struggle for systemic change. <br> <br> <b><li>Linking with Church-Wide Mission Initiative Programs <br> <br> </b><li>The National Plan will continue to support and work with other mission initiatives (Strengthening the Black Church for the 21</sub><sup>st</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;Century, Communities of Shalom, Racial Ethnic Minority Local Church, Holy Boldness, Shared Mission Focus on Young People, the Bishop&rsquo;s Initiative on Children and the Poor, and Substance Abuse and Related Violence Program) to explore specific places where collaboration and cooperation will enhance the impact of the gospel in those communities. The Plan will continue to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></li><br><li>Affirm the importance of preparing clergy, laypersons, and those who work directly under the auspices of The Plan to become increasingly involved and better equipped to serve in such ministries. </li></li><br><li>Work jointly in programs that address economic and social justice issues for Hispanic/Latino people. </li></li><br><li>Collaborate with other mission initiatives to promote the development of youth ministries, as well as resources for and the training of youth, young adults and their leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></li><br><li>Collaborate with all the racial ethnic national plans to learn from their experience, share insights and cooperate on issues of mutual interest and concern.<br> <b>  <li></li></li><br><li>Strengthening Linkages&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> </b><li>The National Plan has, from its beginning, included the participation and contributions of representatives from CIEMAL (the Council of Evangelical Methodist Churches of Latin America and the Caribbean), The Methodist Church of Puerto Rico, and the Rio Grande Conference of The United Methodist Church. They have provided lay and clergy leadership to conferences in The United Methodist Church that have become involved in ministries with Hispanics as persons have moved from one part of the country to another.&nbsp;&nbsp;The continuing growth and migration of the Hispanic/Latino population in the United States has also reflected persons coming from sister churches in Latin America and Spanish-speaking countries in the Caribbean. It is vital to continue to enable reciprocal sharing of leaders, training resources, and program strategies. Strengthening these linkages will provide opportunities for more effective coordination of the processes involved in recruitment and deployment of personnel. <br> <b><li> </li></li><br><li>SUPPORT <br> <i><li> <br> </i><li>Commitments of General Agencies Supporting the Mission&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br> </b><li>The following agencies have undertaken the commitments listed below in support of the church&rsquo;s Hispanic/Latino mission: <br> <br> <b><i><li>General Board of Church and Society&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></li><br><li></b></i>Design and implement Module III workshops on John Wesley&rsquo;s Theology and his commitment to the impoverished in order to provide Hispanic/Latino leaders with a deeper understanding of our Wesleyan theology and heritage and its commitment to all of God&rsquo;s children. These workshops will focus on training Hispanic/Latino persons to continue the training experience in Hispanic/Latino communities within the context of The National Plan for Hispanic Ministries.<i><br> </i><li>Conduct consultations on &ldquo;Making Connections&rdquo; in Hispanic/Latino Communities in order to design workshops consistent with the Module III format. Such connections to be made will be related to the following areas:&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace with justice, environmental justice, and economic justice (i.e., systemic and structural issues related to immigration justice, criminal justice, juvenile justice, access to health care, employment, housing, etc.). </li></li><br><li></li></li><br><li>Design and conduct a Module III workshop on the Social Principles and Latino United Methodists. This workshop will explore the history and theology of the Social Principles and equip participants to teach and interpret the Social Principles in their congregations and communities. </li></li><br><li>Collaborate with the National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries and with other general agencies to design, test, and perfect model programs and resources to respond to identified needs in implementing the National Plan. </li></li><br><li></li></li><br><li><b><i>General Board of Discipleship </li></li><br><li></b></i>Resource the revitalizing and mobilizing of Hispanic/Latino congregations, particularly through the congregational mobilization process as described earlier in the Plan. </li></li><br><li>Design and update Module III workshops that correspond to GBOD, as well as Modules I and II, for a more effective training program for laity, lay missioners, and pastor-mentors. </li></li><br><li>Design and produce resource materials and training programs to assist non-Hispanic/Latino churches and leaders to be equipped for ministries with Hispanic/Latino people, in collaboration with the National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries and with other general agencies. </li></li><br><li>Collaborate with the National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries and with other general agencies to design, test, and perfect model programs and resources to respond to identified needs in implementing The National Plan.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></li><br><li></li></li><br><li><b><i>General Board of Global Ministries </li></li><br><li></b></i>Provide a process of &ldquo;acompa&#241;amiento&rdquo; (accompanying) and matching grants to assist annual conferences in developing and assessing strategic plans for mission, based on the guidelines developed in collaboration with The National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministry. </li></li><br><li>Collaborate with the General Board of Discipleship in the mobilization of local churches and annual conferences for ministry with Hispanic/Latino peoples, and produce the necessary resources and training programs for local church and annual conference leaders in collaboration with The National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></li><br><li>Continue to create and/or identify placement opportunities that support the strategies of The National Plan for Hispanic/Latino Ministry and recruit, train, commission, and deploy missionaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;These persons will implement the different components of The Plan in annual conferences consistent with the strategies, priorities and procedures of The National Plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></li><br><li>Continue to revise and develop Module III workshops for lay missioners and pastor-mentor teams and other church leaders as needed to respond to new and ongoing challenges, particularly in relation to the development of community ministries in collaboration with other agencies under the direction of The National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></li><br><li>Design and produce resource materials, including demographic data and instruments for research and community analysis, as well as training programs to assist non-Hispanic/Latino churches in ministry with Hispanic/Latino people in collaboration with other general agencies under the direction of The National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries. </li></li><br><li>Continue to promote and administer the Challenge Fund. </li></li><br><li>Collaborate with the National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries and with other general agencies to design, test, and perfect model programs and resources to respond to identified needs in implementing The National Plan. </li></li><br><li></li></li><br><li><b><i>General Board of Higher Education and Ministry</i></li></li><br><li></b>Offer United Methodist Studies of Module III in the annual conferences to develop among the clergy a sense of United Methodist Hispanic/Latino ethos among the Hispanic/Latino communities.

A task force will meet annually in conjunction with the Course of Studies directors. </li></li><br><li>Develop a &ldquo;Semana Wesleyana&rdquo; as a gathering for the United Methodist Hispanic/Latino professors teaching in United Methodist Seminaries and non-United Methodist University Senate approved seminaries to develop dialogue and an ethos within the United Methodist Hispanic/Latino academic community. </li></li><br><li>Develop training events for pastors serving in The United Methodist Church coming from other countries or denominations to help them grow in their understanding of the Hispanic/Latino culture and context, and the doctrine and polity of The United Methodist Church. This would be an on-going program for re-tooling pastors. </li></li><br><li>Collaborate with The National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries and with other general agencies to design, test, and perfect model programs and resources to respond to identified needs in implementing The National Plan. </li></li><br><li></li></li><br><li><b>National Structure for Mission</b><i><br> </i><li> <br> <b><i><li>National Office and Coordinator <br> </b></i><li>An essential component of The National Plan for Hispanic/Latino Ministry, approved in 1992, 1996, and 2000, is a national office headed by a coordinator and guided by a national committee. <br> </li></li><br><li>Several factors make coordination of The Plan an important and necessary function.&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors include the increased awareness and response of annual conferences and local churches; the comprehensive nature of the tasks inherent in The Plan; the multiplicity of resources required from the various program agencies of the church; and the need for a collaborative effort in fulfilling the various roles of each of these agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;A coordinator is needed to work with all general agencies and annual conferences of the church, under the direction of The National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries, to develop and strengthen the components of The National Plan. It is recommended that the office and the position of the coordinator be continued and that they continue to be located within the General Board of Global Ministries. <br> </li></li><br><li><b><i>National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministry </li></li><br><li></b></i>We recommend that for the 2005-2008 quadrennium, the National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries meet at least once a year, with subcommittees and task forces meeting as needed, and that it continues with the current number of 18 members to include the following: </li></li><br><li>Two bishops named by the Council of Bishops, attending with funds from the Episcopal fund. </li></li><br><li>One representative from, and named by, MARCHA (<i>Metodistas Asociados Representando la Causa Hispano-Americana</i>). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;representative from, and named by, CIEMAL (<i>Consejo de Iglesias Evang&#233;licas Metodistas de Am&#233;rica Latina y el Caribe</i>). </li></li><br><li>One representative from, and named by, the Rio Grande Conference. </li></li><br><li>One representative from, and named by, the <i>Iglesia Metodista de Puerto Rico</i>. </li></li><br><li>One elected board (or council) member each from the General Board of Discipleship, the General Board of Church and Society, the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry, the General Board of Global Ministries, and the General Council on Ministries (or its equivalent), all to be selected and funded by their respective agencies. </li></li><br><li>Up to seven at-large members, selected by the National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries in such a way that the committee as a whole reflects the varied constituency of The United Methodist Church with regard to gender, age, laity and clergy, lay missioner and pastor-mentor, Hispanic and non-Hispanic, with jurisdictional inclusiveness as well. One shall be a person involved with Brazilian ministries in the United States. </li></li><br><li>In addition to committee members, at least one staff person from each of the program agencies who has responsibility for Hispanic/Latino ministries within that agency (and other staff resource persons as may be needed) will be invited to serve on the committee with voice but not vote, and one representative each from the General Commission on Religion and Race and the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women will be invited to committee meetings as monitors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, to facilitate communication, a representative from the United Methodist Commission on Communications and another from the General Board of Publications will be invited to attend meetings. All such persons are to be funded by their respective agencies. <br> </font></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> </font></ul></ul></ul></ul><b><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;Functions of the National Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries include the following: <br> <font FACE="Times New Roman">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></i></u>
