As news began filtering out Dec. 26, 2004, of the impossibly huge wave that swept shore after shore in that section of the ocean, as video pictures emerged and surviving residents and tourists shakily told their stories, as international news crews rushed to document incredible scenes of devastation, many hearts were touched. In the end, what is estimated to be 232,000 people from a dozen nations were dead or missing ‚Äî most of them, 169,000, from the Aceh province of northern Sumatra.</P><P>The Rev. R. Randy Day, chief executive of the United Methodist Board of Global Ministries, believes the live coverage of the tsunami‚Äôs aftermath and the timing of its fury ‚Äî the day after Christmas ‚Äî lent a ‚Äúvery personal‚Äù aspect to this disaster. That giving, to the United Methodist Committee on Relief, would eventually amount to $41.5 million, the bulk of which was donated in the first eight months after the tsunami hit. The total is by far the denomination‚Äôs largest giving for a single disaster, according to Roland Fernandes, the board‚Äôs treasurer. {703}</P><P><A name=tsunami></A><STRONG><A href="http://www.umc.org/site/c.gjJTJbMUIuE/b.1309783/k.D6A6/Indonesias_tsunami_recovery_comes_with_complications.htm">Indonesia‚Äôs tsunami recovery comes with complications</A></STRONG></P><P>NEW YORK (UMNS) ‚Äî A year after the tsunami wiped out whole parts of the Aceh Province of Indonesia, the United Methodist Committee on Relief is helping people rebuild their homes, their communities and their livelihoods. But the relief and recovery work has been complicated, according to the Rev. Paul Dirdak, UMCOR‚Äôs chief executive. ‚ÄúThe disaster destroyed a very thin strip of property in a rural province where people lived on the beach but a very wide path in one coastal city,‚Äù he said.</P><P>In the rural area, it has not been so hard to determine property ownership for rebuilding purposes, Dirdak explained. But in a city such as Banda Aceh, where ‚Äúsuch a wide range of pieces of property were destroyed,‚Äù along with property records, the task has been formidable. Other complicating factors include a strain on resources for building materials, such as lumber; the large number of outside organizations helping with recovery, slowing down the permit process; and the ongoing political conflict, which has been assisted by a peace accord in August. {704}</P><P><A name=UMCOR></A><STRONG><A href="http://www.umc.org/site/c.gjJTJbMUIuE/b.1310067/k.599F/UMCOR_continues_tsunami_work_in_Sri_Lanka_other_nations.htm">UMCOR continues tsunami work in Sri Lanka, other nations</A></STRONG></P><P>NEW YORK (UMNS) ‚Äî Although security concerns have increased since the November presidential election in Sri Lanka, the United Methodist Committee on Relief is continuing its tsunami work there. The agency also has addressed tsunami-related needs in India, Thailand and Somalia. Since the beginning of its response, UMCOR has had a partnership with the Methodist Church of Sri Lanka, which has more than 30,000 members from all ethnic groups. A local partnership offers a number of advantages, especially since Sri Lankan Methodists are skilled at peace building and reconciliation and enjoy good relations with both the government and the Tamil rebel movement.<BR>While tsunami projects relating to public infrastructure and income generation have moved ahead, a large-scale housing program approved by UMCOR directors last spring has been postponed to early next year for a variety of reasons, ranging from the weather to government regulations, according to Sharad Aggarwal, an UMCOR staff member in New York. The $8 million housing and community services project will be in the districts of Trincomalee, Ampara, Battacaloa, Matara and Mullaitivu. The Methodist Church has identified about 1,200 families living in camps adjacent to their original communities who will benefit from the project. {705}<BR><BR><A name=Day></A><STRONG><A href="http://www.umc.org/site/c.gjJTJbMUIuE/b.1309739/k.BA76/Day_after_day_Methodist_pastor_assists_fellow_Sri_Lankans.htm">Day after day, Methodist pastor assists fellow Sri Lankans</A></STRONG></P><P>MATARA, Sri Lanka (UMNS) ‚Äî A year ago, the Rev.

Nearly a year after the tsunami hit his country, he continues to face long queues of people outside the church each day. He often fields the questions: ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this? Why are you working for us, day after day?‚Äù His reply is constant: ‚ÄúIt is my duty as a Christian.‚Äù People are surprised that the church assists people without exception and that those receiving help are not asked to be or become a member of the church. Silva is quite explicit when fielding these questions, by telling those who seek assistance from his church that it does not mean they now have to attend church or that they need to be or become members of the church. There is respect for all religions, and Silva does not impose his religion on those of different faiths. {706}</P><P><A name=battered></A><STRONG><A href="http://www.umc.org/site/c.gjJTJbMUIuE/b.1309743/k.C45C/Tsunamibattered_Aceh_Province_searches_for_security_hope.htm">Tsunami-battered Aceh Province searches for security, hope</A></STRONG></P><P>BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (UMNS) ‚Äî It is difficult for an outsider visiting Banda Aceh not to be drawn to the ocean.
