<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" ><font COLOR="#000000">The General Conference of The United Methodist Church affirms the following principles contained in the United Nations Report:&nbsp;&nbsp;Declarations World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, Durban, South Africa, 31 August to 8 September 2001.<br> <b> </b>The General Conference reaffirms the principles of equality and non-discrimination in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and encourages respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction of any kind such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. <br> We, the General Conference, affirm that all peoples and individuals constitute one human family, rich in diversity. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also m embers of the household of God (Ephesians 2:19.) <br> We recognize the fundamental importance of nations, in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance [hereinafter referred to as racism]; and, the need to consider signing, ratifying or acceding to all relevant international human rights instruments, with a view to international adherence. <br> We recognize that religion, spirituality and belief can contribute to the promotion of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person and to the eradication of racism. <br> We recognize that racism reveals itself<b> </b>in a different<b> </b>manner for women and girls, and can be among the factors leading to deterioration in their living conditions, poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination, and the limitation or denial of their human rights. <br> We recognize the need to develop a more systematic and consistent approach to evaluating and monitoring racial discrimination against women, children and youth. <br> Therefore, we, the General Conference, urge: <br> That, in light of these affirmations and principles, each nation in which The United Methodist Church is established to adhere to the principles and programs contained in the opening statements. <br> That the United States, all nations and The United Methodist Church incorporate a gender perspective in all programs of action against racism. <br> That the United States, all nations, and the United Methodist Church undertake detailed research on racism, especially in respect to its affect on women, children and youth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> That the United States, all nations and the United Methodist Church address the burden of such discrimination on women, children and youth and promote their participation in the economic and productive development of their communities, especially in respect to: <br> The increased proportion of women migrant workers, human rights violations perpetrated against them and the contribution they make to the economies of their countries or their host countries. <br> The large number of children and young people, particularly girls, who are victims of racism. <br> The rights of children belonging to an ethnic, religious, linguistic minority or indigenous community and their right individually or in community to enjoy their own culture, their own religion, and their own language. <br> Child labor and its links to poverty, lack of development and related social-economic conditions that can perpetuate poverty and racial discrimination disproportionately, denying children a productive life and economic growth. <br> Education at all levels and all ages. <br> That the United States, all nations and the appropriate structures of The United Methodist Church involve women, children and youth in decision-making at all levels related to the eradication of racism. <br> That the General Commission on Religion and Race, the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women, in consultation with the Women&rsquo;s Division of the General Board of Global Ministries, create a monitoring instrument for assessing evidences of racism in programs for and with women, children and youth. <br> That all national mission institutions, schools and institutions of higher education, annual conferences and general agencies evaluate current and projected programs to determine their impact in reducing racism in programs for women, children and youth. <br> <font COLOR="#000000" >That a report be prepared and presented to each General Conference by the General Commission on Religion and Race, the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women, in consultation with the Women&rsquo;s Division of the General Board of Global Ministries, related to the status of women, children and youth impacted by racism.<font FACE="Tahoma">
