Although it was a new plan as of that date, the Ministers Reserve Pension Fund, the Partial Reserve Pension Fund, the Local Pastors Reserve Pension Fund, the Senior Plan, the Ministers Reserve Pension Plan, and the Current Income Distribution Pension Plan were merged into MPP as supplement one to MPP, effective January 1, 1982. The benefits payable under those Prior Plans will be paid in accordance with the provisions of supplement one to MPP, as reflected in Supplement One hereto, effective January 1, 2007. <br> <b>A1.3</b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></i>The Program.</b> The Program, as approved by General Conference 2004 and as applied to any Plan Sponsor, consists of the following subdivisions, plus any others that may be added to the Program (and minus any others that may be removed from the Program) from time to time: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part A, also known as the Common Part; <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part B, also known as the Core Defined Benefit Part; <br> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part C, also known as the Core Defined Contribution Part; <br> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplement One, also formerly known as supplement one to MPP, also known (together with Part A and the Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor) as the Pre-82 Plan; <br> (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplement Two, also formerly known as supplement two to MPP; <br> (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplement Three, also known (together with Part A, Supplement Two, and the Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor) as MPP or the Ministerial Pension Plan; and <br> (g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Program will apply to a Participant, a Terminated Participant, a Beneficiary, a Contingent Annuitant, a Recipient, or an Accountholder as of the earlier of the date such person first became eligible for the Program or first had an Accrued Benefit or an Account and will remain applicable, as the Program exists from time to time, until such person no longer has an Accrued Benefit or an Account under the Program. If any issue under the Program applies after such person&rsquo;s Accrued Benefit has been paid or Account has been distributed, then the terms of the Program as they existed on the date of such payment or distribution will apply to such person. In the case of a Beneficiary or any other person who does not have an Accrued Benefit or an Account but who claims a benefit under the Program, the terms of the Program as they existed at the time or times such person would have been entitled to an Accrued Benefit or an Account if such claim were upheld will govern. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >A1.4</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Plans.</b><br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purpose of the nomenclature of the Program, there are four Plans within the Program: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Core Defined Benefit Plan, which is comprised of Parts A and B and the Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor; <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Core Defined Contribution Plan, which is comprised of Parts A and C and the Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor; <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pre-82 Plan, which is comprised of Part A, Supplement One, Supplement Three, and the Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor; and <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPP, which is comprised of Part A, Supplement Two, Supplement Three, and the Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplement Two provides a special benefit through MPP but is not a separate Plan. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Core Defined Benefit Plan and the Core Defined Contribution Plan are active Plans. The Pre-82 Plan is frozen as to further Service, but Pre-82 Sponsors retain the right to amend it from time to time to increase benefits accrued by Participants still in Service, benefits accrued by Participants no longer in Service but not yet In Pay Status, and benefits payable to persons In Pay Status, by increasing the Past Service Rate. MPP is a frozen Plan as to all Participants, except Bishops, as of December 31, 2006. MPP remains an active Plan for Bishops, who remain active Participants in MPP until August 31, 2008, at which point the remainder of MPP becomes frozen. Account balances not yet In Pay Status remain invested under Supplement Three until each Participant&rsquo;s Annuity Starting Date, with the benefits thereupon generally being transferred to and paid from the Core Defined Benefit Plan and/or the Core Defined Contribution Plan to the extent further described in Supplement Three. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purpose of separate funding, there are four plans within the Program: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Consolidated DB Plan; <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Core Defined Contribution Plan; <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Personal Contributions Accumulation, together with the Service Annuity Accumulation of the Pre-82 Plan, before either has been annuitized; and <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPP, before its account balances have been transferred or annuitized. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets for each of these four plans will be separately accounted for in the Trust and will not be commingled or transferred except as otherwise specifically provided in the Program. Assets from one of these plans will not be used to fund another of these plans (except as otherwise specifically provided in the Program). Each of these four plans will be treated as a separate single plan within the meaning of Regulation �1.414(l)-1(b)(1). <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >A1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type of Plans.</b> Each of the plans listed in Section A1.4(c) is intended to be a program of one or more church-sponsored retirement income accounts within the meaning of Code �403(b)(9), with the Consolidated DB Plan being a defined benefit plan, as that term is defined in Code �414(j), and the plans listed in Sections A1.4(c)(ii)-(iv) being defined contribution plans, as that term is defined in Code �414(i). The Consolidated DB Plan is a grandfathered pre-August 14, 1982 defined benefit Code �403(b) plan under Code �403(b)(9) in accordance with the House-Senate Conference Committee Agreement provisions of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. For the purpose of Code �401(a)(4), the Program is intended to be a multiple employer plan involving more than one Plan Sponsor. Plan Sponsors may or may not be Affiliates of one another. For the purpose of Code �414(e), the Plan Sponsors are each intended to be a church, a convention or association of churches (within the meaning of Code �414(e)(3)(C)), or an organization controlled by or associated with a church or a convention or association of churches (within the meaning of Code �414(e)(3)(D)). Accordingly, the Plan Sponsors are intended to be one employer for the purpose of Code �414(e). Further, the Program is intended to meet the requirements of a &ldquo;church plan&rdquo; as that term is defined in Code �414(e) and ERISA �3(33) and to be exempt from ERISA as a Church Plan to the extent permitted under Code �410(d), applicable ERISA sections (including, but not limited to, ERISA ��4(b)(2) and 4021(b)(3)), and any other applicable law. <br> <b>A1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Funding.</b> Contributions to fund the benefits provided under the Program are made by the Plan Sponsors as provided in each Plan. <br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Trust</i>. To receive the contributions, the General Board has established the Trust pursuant to the Trust Agreement. All benefits under the Program will be provided exclusively by distributions from the Trust. The Trustee has the powers and duties specified in the Trust Agreement. The General Board has the authority to replace the Trustee of the Trust at any time, or to establish additional Trusts to fund benefits under the Program. <br> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Insurance Contracts</i>. Benefits under the Program may also, at the General Board&rsquo;s discretion, be provided by the purchase of insurance contracts, and, in such event, the term Trust will also include the Program&rsquo;s interest, if any, in such insurance contracts. Such insurance contracts may be entered into by the General Board or by the Trustee in accordance with the General Board&rsquo;s direction. <br> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Separate Accounts</i>. The Administrator will maintain a separate accounting for each of the Regulation �1.414(l)-1(b)(1) plans identified in Section A1.4(c), for each Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s contributions under each such plan (subject to Section A1.6(d)), and for each Participant, Beneficiary, or Accountholder under the plans in Sections A1.4(c)(ii)-(iv). Such accounting will reflect contributions, earnings, losses, forfeitures, transfers, distributions, and any other relevant events necessary to keep accurate accounts. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Defined Benefit Funding.</i> Each Plan Sponsor will be primarily responsible to fund benefit payments to Participants, Terminated Participants, Beneficiaries, Contingent Annuitants, and any other persons entitled to a benefit under the Consolidated DB Plan. The funding for each constituent subplan of the Consolidated DB Plan will be accomplished as provided in Part B and each of the Supplements by each Plan Sponsor making contributions to its Funding Account, which will serve to pay all benefits due from that Plan Sponsor under the Consolidated DB Plan. Subject to any rules or limitations established by the Plan Administrator, all assets in a Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s Funding Account are available to pay all benefits attributable to that Plan Sponsor under the Consolidated DB Plan. If, however, a Plan Sponsor does not have sufficient assets in its Funding Account to pay all benefits of the Consolidated DB Plan as they come due, in order to pay such benefits, the Administrator will authorize debits against the Funding Accounts of all other Plan Sponsors (except any Plan Sponsor with a zero Funding Account balance), pro rata in proportion to the Liabilities each such other Plan Sponsor has as a percentage of all Liabilities under the Consolidated DB Plan (as determined by the Administrator). If the delinquent Plan Sponsor later makes contributions to its Funding Account, such contributions will first be allocated pro rata in the same fashion to repay amounts taken from other Plan Sponsors&rsquo; Funding Accounts, plus interest at a market rate to be determined by the Administrator from time to time, and only thereafter to the delinquent Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s separate Funding Account. <br> (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Reversion from a Funding Account.</i> No Plan Sponsor may receive a reversion of assets in its Funding Account unless assets remain after all liabilities of all Plan Sponsors and the Consolidated DB Plan have been satisfied as to all Participants, Beneficiaries, and any other persons entitled to benefits under such plan. When all such liabilities have been satisfied by the payment of all benefits due, by annuitizing any remaining benefits with an insurance or annuity provider selected by the Administrator, and/or by converting, merging, or spinning off any remaining benefits to Actuarially Equivalent lump sum or annuity benefits to be paid from another plan or insurance contract, any remaining assets in each Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s Funding Account will be returned by the Trustee to that Plan Sponsor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, assets may also be returned to a Plan Sponsor as provided in Section A4.3. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A1.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exclusive Benefit.</b> The Program is for the exclusive benefit of Recipients and Accountholders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Recipient or an Accountholder is not required to apply for or begin the receipt of benefits under the Program until his or her Required Beginning Date. Written notice of the disposition of a claim will be sent to the Plan Sponsor and to the Claimant within 45 days after all required forms and materials related to the claim have been filed. If special circumstances require an extension of time, written notice of the extension will be furnished to the Claimant, and written notice of the disposition of a claim will be sent within an additional 90 days. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Denial of Claim. </i>If any claim for benefits under a Plan is wholly or partially denied, the Administrator will send the Claimant written notice of the denial, within the period specified in Section A3.11(a) above, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant, setting forth the following information: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the specific reasons for such denial; <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based; <br> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and <br> (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an explanation of the Program&rsquo;s appeals procedures. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Appeal of Denial. </i>If a Claimant is denied benefits under Section A3.11(b), the Claimant has the right to appeal the decision within 90 days after the date of the claim denial, in accordance with the following procedures: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Intermediary Appeal Procedure</i>.

Such an appeal may be addressed to the Administrator or in care of the person or persons specified in the notice of denial issued under Section A3.11(c)(i). <br> (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A timely filed appeal will be heard by the Final Appeals Committee at its next meeting, unless additional time is needed for processing, in which case the Claimant will be so notified and the appeal will be heard at the following meeting of the Final Appeals Committee. Appeals or documents filed fewer than 30 days before the next meeting of the Final Appeals Committee will not be considered by the Final Appeals Committee except by its leave and discretion. <br> (C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Claimant or a representative of the Plan Sponsor may request permission to appear personally or by teleconference before the Final Appeals Committee to present evidence with respect to the claim, subject to conditions and time limitations set by the Final Appeals Committee, but the expense for any such personal appearance must be borne by the Claimant or the Plan Sponsor. <br> (D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Final Appeals Committee will decide a Claimant&rsquo;s appeal, and its decision will be final. The decision will be implemented by the Administrator. <br> (E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Claimant will be given written notice of the decision on appeal. If the decision is a denial, such notice will include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant, and specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based. Such written notice will be mailed to the claimant by the Administrator within 15 days following the decision by the Final Appeals Committee. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Appeals Committees</i>. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Appeals Intermediary is a committee appointed by the Administrator. <br> (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Final Appeals Committee of the Administrator is a committee of the Board of Directors of the General Board that is selected from time to time by that Board. <br> (C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the Appeals Intermediary and the Final Appeals Committee may develop rules and procedures to govern its own meetings and actions and the filing and decision of claim appeals by Claimants. <br> (D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any failure by either appeals committee to decide a claim appeal by the deadline for such a decision will be deemed a denial of the claim. The Claimant may then proceed to the next step of the procedure. <br> (E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any failure by the Claimant to appeal any claim denial by the deadline for doing so will be deemed to be a final resolution of the claim, and the Claimant will be deemed to have waived his or her right to file an appeal or a further appeal or to pursue any other remedy, including filing a lawsuit. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Appeal a Condition Precedent to Civil Action</i>.

Any such cause of action must be filed with a court of competent jurisdiction within six months of the date on the written notice of denial described in Section A3.11(c)(ii)(E) or such cause of action will be deemed waived, provided, however, that such six-month limit will apply only if it is described in such notice of denial. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A3.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualified Domestic Relations Orders.</b> The provisions of Section A4.2 notwithstanding, all or part of a Participant&rsquo;s Vested benefits arising under this Program may be transferred to one or more Alternate Payees on the basis of a &ldquo;qualified domestic relations order,&rdquo; as that term is defined in Code �414(p), provided that: (1) such order was issued by a court having jurisdiction over the Administrator; or (2) such order was entered by any other court and the Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines that the order is a QDRO. <br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When appropriate, the Administrator will provide a Participant involved in marital litigation with information regarding the nature and value of the Participant&rsquo;s benefits and will assist the Participant and the court in interpreting that information. <br> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Administrator will establish a written procedure to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such qualified orders. Such procedure will provide that during the period in which a determination is being made with respect to the qualified status of an order received by the Administrator and for 30 days thereafter: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Administrator will direct the Trustee to segregate and separately account for any sums payable to the Participant that the order requires to be paid to the Alternate Payee; and <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Participant will be prohibited from electing to receive any distribution that would compromise the rights granted to the Alternate Payee by the order, without the Alternate Payee&rsquo;s written consent. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither the Alternate Payee nor any person claiming through the Alternate Payee will have the right to transfer benefits to another Alternate Payee.

With respect to benefits transferred to an Alternate Payee pursuant to this Section A3.12, the Alternate Payee will have all of the rights and duties of a fully Vested Participant who had incurred a Termination of Employment, to the exclusion of any claim thereto on the part of the Participant. <br> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A subpoena or other instrument of judicial process that: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is directed to the Administrator, its constituent corporations, or its officers or employees; <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appears on its face to be issued in the course of marital litigation to which a Participant is a party; and <br> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seeks information regarding the nature or value of the Participant&rsquo;s pension benefits, may be honored by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, without interposing any defense on the grounds of technical or jurisdictional defect. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Administrator may charge to the Program its costs of handling QDROs, including, but not limited to, attorneys&rsquo; fees, litigation expenses, and a reasonable charge for its services in connection therewith. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION A4 - General Provisions</b><font SIZE="5"><br> </font></b></b></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rules and Forms.</b> The Administrator will have the authority and responsibility to: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adopt rules, regulations, and policies for the administration of this Program, in all matters not specifically covered by General Conference legislation or by reasonable implication; and <br> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prescribe such forms and records as are needed for the administration of the Program. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-Alienation of Benefits.</b> No benefits payable at any time under the Program will be subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, pledge, attachment, garnishment, or encumbrance of any kind.

No financial obligations, other than those that can be met by the contributions actually received and the investment results, reduced by any of the Administrator&rsquo;s or Trustee&rsquo;s expenses or charges against the Trust&rsquo;s assets, will be assumed by the Administrator or the Trustee. To the extent that assets of a Plan attributable to a Recipient or an Accountholder have been transferred to a separate dedicated trust, all benefits to which the Recipient or Accountholder is entitled under that Plan will be provided only out of such trust and only to the extent the trust is adequate therefor. Further, if the Trustee segregates Trust assets by Plan within the Program, all benefits to which a Recipient or an Accountholder is entitled under that Plan will be provided only out of such segregated portion of the Trust and only to the extent such segregated portion is adequate therefor.

To the extent that any such rules or benefits are in conflict with the general provisions of the Program, such rules or benefits will supersede the general provisions of the Program as to the persons covered by the Supplement to the extent they are in conflict with such general provisions.

The amount that must be distributed on or before a Participant's Required Beginning Date (or, if the Participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under Section B9.4(a)(ii)(A) or (B)) is the payment that is required for one Payment Interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next Payment Interval even if that Payment Interval ends in the next calendar year. All of the Participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for Payment Intervals ending on or after the Participant's Required Beginning Date. <br> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Additional Accruals After First Distribution Calendar Year</i>. Any additional benefits accruing to a Participant in a calendar year after the first Distribution Calendar Year will be distributed beginning with the first Payment Interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Requirements for Annuity Distributions that Begin During Participant's Lifetime</i>. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Joint-Life Annuities Where the Contingent Annuitant Is Not the Participant's Spouse</i>. If a Participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a Contingent Annuity for the joint lives of the Participant and a non-Spouse Contingent Annuitant, annuity payments to be made on or after the Participant's Required Beginning Date to the Contingent Annuitant after the Participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the Participant using the table set forth in Regulation �401(a)(9)-6T, Q&A-2. If the form of distribution combines a Contingent Annuity for the joint lives of the Participant and a non-Spouse Contingent Annuitant and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the Contingent Annuitant after the expiration of the period certain. <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Period-Certain Annuities</i>. Unless a Participant's Spouse is the sole Designated Beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain with no lifetime benefit annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the Participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the Participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Regulation �1.401(a)(9)-9 for the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting Date. If the Annuity Starting Date precedes the year in which the Participant attains age 70, the applicable distribution period for the Participant is the distribution period for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Regulation �1.401(a)(9)-9 plus the excess of 70 over the age of the Participant as of the Participant's birthday in the year that contains the Annuity Starting Date. If the Participant's Spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and joint-life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the Participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this Section B9.4(c)(ii), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Participant and the Participant's Spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Regulation �1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant's and Spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and Spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting Date. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Small Benefit</i>. Notwithstanding the foregoing portions of this Section B9.4, except in the case of a distribution to a Disabled Participant or a Disabled Terminated Participant, if a Participant&rsquo;s or a Terminated Participant&rsquo;s Accrued Benefit at the time of distribution does not exceed $5,000 (as an Actuarially Equivalent lump sum), the entire amount of the Accrued Benefit will be distributed as soon as administratively feasible in a lump sum to the Recipient who is entitled to receive it under the terms of the Plan.

If the Recipient fails to contact the Administrator within 12 months, the Recipient will be presumed dead and such benefit will be forfeited (except as provided in Section B9.5(c)) and will become the benefit of the next Recipient in line (except as provided in Section B9.5(b)) in accordance with the applicable form of payment. The Administrator will then send notice by certified letter as provided above to the next Recipient in line, and the process specified above will be repeated until the last successor Recipient is sent a notification. <br> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the last successor or default Recipient fails to contact the Administrator within 12 months after being sent notification of a benefit due as provided in Section B9.5(a), then the amount specified in Section B9.5(a) will be forfeited.

If a benefit has been paid to a successor Recipient, the forfeiture as to all predecessor Recipients will become permanent. If the 12-month period described in Section B9.5(b) has elapsed, then such benefit will be permanently forfeited and will remain in the Funding Account from which it would otherwise have been paid to fund other benefits payable under the Plan. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B9.6</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Payment with Respect to Incapacitated Recipients.</b> Whenever, in the Administrator&rsquo;s opinion, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit under the Plan is under a legal disability (including being a minor) or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage such person&rsquo;s financial affairs, the Administrator may direct the Trustee to make payments directly to the person, to the person&rsquo;s legal representative (including a custodian for such person under the applicable Uniform Gifts or Transfers to Minors Act or similar legislation), or to a relative or friend of the person to be used exclusively for such person&rsquo;s benefit, or apply any such payment for the benefit of the person in such manner as the Administrator deems advisable. The decision of the Administrator, in each case, will be final, binding, and conclusive upon all persons interested hereunder. The Administrator will not be obligated to see to the proper application or expenditure of any payment so made. Any benefit payment (or installment thereof) made in accordance with the provisions of this Section B9.6 will completely discharge the obligation for making such payment under the Plan, and the Administrator will have no further liability on account thereof. <br> <b>B9.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitation on Liability for Distributions.</b> All rights and benefits, including benefit elections, provided to a Participant or Terminated Participant under this Plan will be subject to the rights afforded to any Alternate Payee under a QDRO. Further, a distribution to an Alternate Payee will be permitted if such distribution is authorized by a QDRO, even if the affected Participant or Terminated Participant has not incurred a Termination of Conference Relationship or attained any particular age. <br> <b>B9.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relinquishment.</b> Any Recipient may Relinquish any benefit or portion thereof that is due to him or her under the Plan if it is done in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and before receiving it. The Relinquishment will be effective for any monthly benefit payments due after it is made, will remain in effect in accordance with its terms for future benefit payments (until revoked), and may be revoked at any time (prospectively only), in accordance with rules or procedures adopted from time to time by the Administrator, as to monthly benefits not yet due.

Each Participant&rsquo;s share of the Non-Elective Contributions will be allocated to the Participant&rsquo;s Non-Elective Contributions Account as of the Accounting Date coinciding with or next succeeding the date they are deposited in the Trust. <br> <b>C4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late Contributions.</b> If a Plan Sponsor delays in making a Non-Elective Contribution to the Plan on behalf of any Participant until after the Due Date specified in Section C4.2, then the Plan Sponsor will make such delayed Non-Elective Contribution to the Plan as soon as possible thereafter, along with imputed earnings on such delayed Non-Elective Contribution based on a fixed rate of interest or on projected earnings as established by the Administrator from case to case or time to time, credited from the day after such Due Date until the Accounting Date such Non-Elective Contribution was actually credited to the Participant&rsquo;s Account. For the purpose of Code �415, such replacement Non-Elective Contributions (including imputed earnings) will be treated as specified in Section C3.5. Any special services provided by the Administrator in connection with this Section C4.3 are subject to the additional charges provided for in Section A3.7(c). <br> <b>C4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ineligible Participants.</b> If a Participant ceases to qualify under Section C3.1, is on an unpaid Leave of Absence (except as otherwise required under Section A4.9 (relating to USERRA) or applicable law), is suspended from employment without pay, or is otherwise not earning Compensation for a payroll period for a reason not covered under Section C3.1, but has not Retired or incurred a Termination of Conference Relationship, then for any such period the Participant&rsquo;s Accounts will not be credited with any Non-Elective Contributions. <br> <b>C4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transfer of MPP Benefit.</b> If the terms of Supplement Three so provide, the Administrator will transfer the MPP Converted DC Benefit of each Accountholder who has one from MPP to this Plan. But such MPP Converted DC Benefit will be distributed under this Plan as soon as practicable and will not be invested under this Plan. If the MPP Converted DC Benefit cannot be distributed promptly under this Plan, then it will be transferred back to Supplement Three and invested in accordance with the terms of that Supplement until it may be distributed in accordance with this Plan (provided that it is re-transferred to this Plan from Supplement Three in accordance therewith). If, after any transfer of an Accountholder&rsquo;s MPP Converted DC Benefit to this Plan, a late contribution is received by MPP or there is some other adjustment to a Participant&rsquo;s MPP Account Balance, the Administrator will make an appropriate equitable adjustment to such Participant&rsquo;s Account Balance under this Plan or MPP to reflect the intention of transferring the Participant&rsquo;s MPP Converted DC Benefit to this Plan on or about the Accountholder&rsquo;s Annuity Starting Date, which equitable adjustment may involve transferring amounts from this Plan back to MPP. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b></b><CENTER><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION C5 - Limits on Contributions <br> </font></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >C5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit on Annual Additions. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Limitation. </i>Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, the amount of Annual Additions allocated to a Participant&rsquo;s Account for any Limitation Year will not exceed an amount equal to the lesser of: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $41,000 (in 2004 or as indexed under Code �415(d) in later years); or <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100% of the Participant&rsquo;s 415 Compensation for the Limitation Year; <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reduced, in either case, by the amount of Annual Additions credited to the Participant&rsquo;s account for the Limitation Year under any other defined contribution plan maintained by a Plan Sponsor or a 415 Affiliate. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Error in Previous Limitation Year</i>.

If a sum in a 415 Suspense Account has not been so reallocated to Participant Accounts within two Plan Years after the close of the Plan Year in which the sum was first allocated to the 415 Suspense Account, then such sum will be used by the Administrator as soon as is practicable to reduce the Contributions due from all other Plan Sponsors.

Each Non-Elective Contributions Account represents the aggregate amount of Non-Elective Contributions, less any withdrawals or distributions charged thereto, and adjusted by the earnings, gains, losses, expenses, and unrealized appreciation or depreciation attributable to such Contributions, all in accordance with generally applicable accounting rules and procedures established by the Administrator from time to time. The maintenance of separate Account Balances will not require physical segregation of plan assets with respect to any Account. The Accounts maintained hereunder represent the Accountholders&rsquo; interests in the Plan and Trust and are intended as bookkeeping records to assist the Administrator in the administration of the Plan. Any reference in the Core Defined Contribution Plan to an Accountholder&rsquo;s &ldquo;Account(s)&rdquo; or &ldquo;Account Balance(s)&rdquo; refers to all amounts credited to the Non-Elective Contributions Account maintained in the Accountholder&rsquo;s name under the Plan unless the context otherwise requires.

The payments will continue until the Accountholder changes his or her distribution option or until the Accountholder&rsquo;s entire Account Balance in the Plan has been distributed. Until such time, income, gains, losses, expenses, and unrealized appreciation or depreciation will continue to be allocated to the Account in accordance with Section C6.

If the first payment is made in the year that includes the last day (April 1) of the Required Beginning Date, such payment will relate to the immediately preceding year, will be computed as though paid in such preceding year, and will be subtracted from the Account Balance in computing the second annual payment, which will be due by December 31 of the same year in which the first payment was made. <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installments may be paid more often than annually, in accordance with rules established by the Administrator, so long as, when required by Code �401(a)(9), the total amount distributed in any year satisfies the minimum distribution requirement of Sections C8.1(c)(i) and C8.4. Distributions in excess of the minimum requirement in any year will not reduce the minimum required distribution in later years.

Periodic distributions, including mandatory partial lump sum distributions, will be required thereafter as provided in Section C8.4. <br> (g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tax Notice</i>. Before making any Eligible Rollover Distribution, the Administrator will furnish each Accountholder with a notice describing his or her right to a direct rollover of the distribution and the tax consequences of the distribution. Such notice will be furnished not more than 90 days nor fewer than 30 days before the Recipient is entitled to receive such distribution, and no distribution will be made until 30 days after he or she has received such notice unless he or she waives such 30 day period in writing in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payments After an Accountholder&rsquo;s Death.</b> The following provisions are subject to Section C8.4 (relating to required minimum distributions). <br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Distribution on Death.</i> Upon the death of an Accountholder, all amounts credited to such Accountholder&rsquo;s Account will be distributed to his or her Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of the Plan or as otherwise specified in the Plan. <br> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Proof of Death.</i> The Administrator may require such proper proof of death and such evidence of the right of any person to receive payment of the value of the Account of a deceased Accountholder as the Administrator may deem appropriate.
