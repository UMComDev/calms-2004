<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><font COLOR="#000000">WHEREAS, the 2000 session of General Conference called for the formation of a task force to study the relationship of science and theology, and the 2004 session of the General Conference has received the report and recommendations of said task force; and <br> WHEREAS, advances in the sciences are constantly challenging and changing our understanding of the created order; and <br> WHEREAS, it is the responsibility of every congregation of The United Methodist Church to help Christian disciples think theologically and critically about the Christian faith; and <br> WHEREAS, The United Methodist Church lacks an official theological position on the relationship of science and the Christian faith; and <br> WHEREAS, often new discoveries within various disciplines of science come in conflict-or are perceived to come in conflict-with the core beliefs of the church; and <br> WHEREAS, there are currently few resources to help people explore the critical relationship between faith and science; and <br> WHEREAS, a growing population of Christians who are working in the applied fields of the various science disciplines are seeking assistance to integrate their faith and vocation; and <br> WHEREAS, new discoveries and advancements in medicine, biology, astronomy, physics, anthropology, computer technology, and other scientific and technological disciplines will continue to challenge our understanding of the known world and God&rsquo;s creation; and <br> WHEREAS, many congregational leaders, both clergy and laity, are ill-equipped to address the overwhelming number of issues that arise between scientific advancement and Christian faith to help Christian disciples deepen their understanding and grow spiritually; and <br> WHEREAS, both science and theology have the potential to enrich the lives of current and future generations, and this value could be greatly enhanced through partnership and cooperation; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved that</i> the General Council on Ministries, or its successor body, assemble a group of one representative bishop; representatives (1 each) from the General Board of Church and Society, General Board of Higher Education and Ministry, General Board of Discipleship, and The United Methodist Publishing House; and six to eight seminary and university professors to create a theological statement for The United Methodist Church concerning the relationship of science and theology, to be presented for adoption at the 2008 session of General Conference; and <br> <i>Be it further resolved that</i> the General Board of Discipleship will consult with the United Methodist Publishing House and the General Board of Church and Society to consider the implications of creating resources for youth and adults and to develop a plan to submit to the Curriculum Resources Committee of the General Board of Discipleship to create <br> a) group process resources that assist local congregations and small groups in dealing with controversial and potentially divisive issues-including but not restricted to those raised by the relationship of science and the Christian faith-in appropriate, respectful, and productive ways; <br> b) specific topical curriculum that addresses emerging knowledge from the various scientific and technological disciplines; and <br> <i>Be it further resolved that</i> the General Board of Discipleship, in consultation with the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry, the General Board of Church and Society, and the General Council on Ministries (or its successor body), develop a plan for a variety of forums (such as online conversations, satellite teleconferences, educational consultations, face-to-face meetings, registration fee-based events, and so forth) for dialogue between scientists, theologians, researchers, church leaders, students, and other appropriate and interested parties in order to help them stay current with the latest developments in science and technology and to continuously improve the dialogue between the disciplines of science and the Christian faith; and <br> <i>Be it further resolved that</i> the above named bodies receive copies of the report of the task force on the relationship of science and theology as groundwork and guidance for their assigned tasks.</b><font COLOR="#000000" ><br> <font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
