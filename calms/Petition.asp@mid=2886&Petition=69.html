and, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, the 1988 General Conference of The United Methodist Church affirmed the COCU Consensus as an authentic expression of the apostolic faith and a sufficient theological foundation for covenanting; and, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, the 1996 General Conference adopted <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Churches in Covenant Communion: Churches of Christ Uniting </i><font FACE="Times New Roman">as the definitive agreement for joining with other churches in covenant communion;

and, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, the 2000 General Conference of The United Methodist Church: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * affirmed the progress of the Consultation on Church Union in its journey toward greater visible unity among the member churches under the name of Churches Uniting in Christ; and <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * affirmed the following <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Marks of Unity </i><font FACE="Times New Roman">as goals on the journey to be lived out when in accord with <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">The Book of Discipline</i><font FACE="Times New Roman">: <br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutual recognition of each other as authentic expressions of the one church of Jesus Christ, <br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutual recognition of members in one baptism, <br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutual recognition that each affirms the apostolic faith of Scripture and tradition which is expressed in the Apostles&rsquo; and Nicene Creeds and that each seeks to give witness to the apostolic faith in its life and mission, <br> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision for celebration of the Eucharist together with intentional regularity, <br> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Engagement together in Christ&rsquo;s mission on a regular and intentional basis, especially a shared mission to combat racism, <br> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Intentional commitment to promote unity with wholeness and to oppose all marginalization&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> and exclusion in church and society based on such things as race, age, gender, forms of disability, sexual orientation, and class, <br> 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate structures of accountability and appropriate means for consultation and decision making, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;An ongoing process of theological dialogue and, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, the 2000 General Conference of The United Methodist Church directed: (1) the Council of Bishops and the General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious Concerns (GCCUIC) to lead The United Methodist Church in its membership in the Consultation on Church Union and to continue dialogue with covenanting partners, clarifying questions and developing a covenanting process;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Therefore, be it resolved,</i><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;that the 2004 General Conference of The United Methodist&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Church reaffirm its membership in and support of Churches Uniting in Christ in accordance with <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">The Book of Discipline </i><font FACE="Times New Roman">2000, and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Be it further resolved</i><font FACE="Times New Roman">, that the 2004 General Conference direct the Council of Bishops and the General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious Concerns to lead The United Methodist Church in its membership in Churches Uniting in Christ and in being a good neighbor.<font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
