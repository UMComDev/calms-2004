Purpose</i> <i>-- </i>Growth in church membership and financial stewardship are among the indicators of the denomination&rsquo;s effectiveness in fulfilling its mission to make disciples of Jesus Christ (� 120) and to be a redemptive witness to God&rsquo;s love in the world. The mission is fulfilled in part through the ministries of jurisdictional and central conferences and the number of bishops eligible for election in each should reflect jurisdictional and central conference effectiveness and the need for leadership in the Church&rsquo;s mission. For purposes of this paragraph, church membership will equal the number of persons listed on the roll of professing members (new � 215). <br> 2. <i>Number of bishops for jurisdictional conferences -- </i>The number of bishops eligible for election in jurisdictional conferences shall be determined as follows: <br>  a) A jurisdictional conference with fewer than 300,000 in church membership may elect up to two (2) bishops; however, nothing herein shall be construed to limit the right of those empowered by � 37 to change the number, names, and boundaries of jurisdictional conferences. <br> </font></b></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >b) A jurisdictional conference with church membership of 300,000 will be eligible to elect five bishops. A jurisdictional conference with church membership of more than 300,000 will be eligible to elect one additional bishop for each additional 300,000 members gained (subject to (new � 405.5)) and will lose the right to elect one with a similar decline in church membership (subject to (new � 405.6)), according to the following: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="590" bordercolorlight="#000000" bordercolordark="#000000" bordercolor="#000000"><tr><td></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><font FACE="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="3">Membership</font></td><td><font FACE="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="3">&nbsp;</font></td><td><font FACE="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="3"> Bishops</font></td></tr><tr><td>

</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> c) In very exceptional cases, the number of bishops allocated to a jurisdiction may be increased if essential for missional needs after presenting plans and timetables in accordance with (new � 405.8) and with the approval of General Conference. <br> </font><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >3. Number of bishops in central conferences --</i> The number of bishops eligible for election in central conferences shall be determined as follows: <br> a) Africa Central Conference shall be entitled to elect five bishops; Congo Central Conference shall be entitled to elect three bishops; and West Africa Central Conference shall be entitled to elect three bishops. Central and Southern Europe Central Conference shall be entitled to elect one bishop; Germany Central <br> </font></i></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Conference shall be entitled to elect one bishop; and Northern Europe Central Conference shall be entitled to elect two bishops. The Philippines Central Conference shall be entitled to elect three bishops. <br> b) Based on church membership reported under (new �405.4) for the quadrennium ending in 2004, a central conference shall be eligible to elect one additional bishop for each twenty-five percent (25 percent) increase in church membership (subject to (new �405.5)) and shall lose one bishop for each twenty-five percent (25 percent) loss in church membership (subject to (new � 405.6)). If church membership declines by fifty percent (50 percent) or if the central conference loses the only bishop it is entitled to elect, the central conference committee on episcopacy will present a plan and timetable, in accordance with (new � 405.8) for realigning central conference boundaries. <br> </font><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >4. Reporting of Church Membership</i> -- The General Council on Finance and Administration will annually report membership statistics for each jurisdiction to the jurisdictional college of bishops and committee on episcopacy and, for each central conference, to the central conference college of bishops and committee on episcopacy, who shall review such reports to identify trends affecting the number of bishops eligible for election during the next quadrennium. The statistics reported under this paragraph will be the most recent available church membership statistics gathered from annual conferences. <br> <i>5. Increasing</i> <i>the Number of Bishops Eligible for Election</i> -- Whenever the statistics reported under (new � 405.4) for the second year of the quadrennium would result in an increase in the number of bishops eligible for election by a jurisdictional or central conference, the change will become effective at the beginning of the next quadrennium. Provided, however, no increase in the number of bishops eligible for election will become effective unless and until a plan for deploying the additional bishop and a timetable for the annual conferences of the jurisdictional or central conference, whichever is appropriate, to fully fund their Episcopal Fund apportionment have been submitted and favorably considered in accordance with (new � 405.8). <br> <i>6. Reducing the Number of Bishops Eligible for Election</i> -- Whenever the statistics reported under (new � 405.4) for the second year of the quadrennium would result in a reduction in the number of bishops eligible for election by a jurisdictional or central conference, the change will become effective at the beginning of the next quadrennium or, if no bishops are eligible for election in the jurisdictional or central conference affected by the change, at the time a bishop next becomes eligible for election. The jurisdictional or central conference committee on episcopacy, whichever is appropriate, will prepare a plan in accordance with (new �405.8) for realigning annual conference lines within jurisdictional or central conference boundaries. <br> <i>7. Pattern of Decline</i> -- Where the change in church membership is not sufficient to reduce the number of bishops eligible for election, but reflects a pattern of decline over three quadrennia, the jurisdictional or central conference committee on episcopacy, whichever is appropriate, will present a plan and timetable, in accordance with (new � 405.8), to affect a change in the trend. <br> <i>8. Review of</i> <i>Plans and Timetables</i> -- When a jurisdictional or central conference committee on episcopacy presents a plan and timetable for an addition to (new � 405.2(c) or new � 405.5) or reduction in (new � 405.6) the number of bishops eligible for election or to reverse a pattern of decline (new �405.7), such plans and timetables will be submitted to the Council of Bishops and the General Council on Finance and Administration for consideration and action in the year prior to the General Conference at which the matter will be considered, or at such other time as may be specified by the General Council on Finance and Administration. The purpose of the review by the General Council on Finance and Administration under this paragraph is limited to determining the budgetary impact, if any. <br> <i>9.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation shall take effect immediately upon adjournment of the 2004 General Conference.</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
