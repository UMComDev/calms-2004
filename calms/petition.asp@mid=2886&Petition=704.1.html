<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >Amend Resolution 9 as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental Racism <br> </font></b></b></CENTER><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Theological Background <br> In Isaiah we are given divine insight into our relations with one another "If you do away with the yoke of oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk ans if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed then your light will rise in the darkness and your night will become like the noonday" Isaiah 58:9.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are further called both in Leviticus and by our Lord Jesus Christ to love our neighbors as ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we turn from this divine will, we as a broken people promote systems that are unjust and inquitable.&nbsp;&nbsp;One manifestation of these injustices is the persistent problem of racism. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Background:</b><br> The United Methodist Church is committed to understanding and eliminating racism. One generally ignored aspect is environmental racism. People of color are disproportionately affected by toxic contamination due to the production, storage, treatment, and disposal process of hazardous materials and wastes. African American, Hispanic North American, Asian American, Native American, and <strike> third world communities</strike>&nbsp; <b>citizens</b> <b>of developing nations </b>are<b> </b>usually the least able, politically and economically, to oppose the sitings of these facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>As a result, their communities have become the dumping grounds for waste with devastating economic and health consequences. <br> The pervasive problem of environmental racism within the United States first came to light in the early 1980's.&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth of the environmental justice movement can be traced to the historic protest in 1983 in Warren County, North Carolina where over 500 people were arrested for blocking the shipment of toxic waste (PCBs) to a landfill in the predominantly black country.&nbsp;&nbsp;That same year, a General Accounting Office (GAO) study concluded "blacks make up the majority of the population in three out of four communities where landfills are located."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <font COLOR="#000000">In 1987, the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice issued the landmark report <i>Toxic Wastes and Race</i>. This report, expanding on the GAO findings, established that race - rather than poverty, land value, or home ownership - is the most reliable predictor of proximity to hazardous waste sites in the United States. And in 1992, the National Law Journal study, <i>Unequal Protection</i>, uncovered racial disparities in the enforcement of environmental protection laws. The report highlighted a &ldquo;racial divide in the way the US government cleans up toxic waste sites and punishes polluters.&rdquo; According to the report, &ldquo;white communities see faster action, better results and stiffer penalties than communities where blacks, Hispanics and other minorities live. This unequal protection often occurs whether the community is wealthy or poor.&rdquo;<br> These and other reports provided strong empirical evidence of environmental racism. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Among the findings: <br> </b><font COLOR="#000000" ><strike> Research has documented the following</strike> : <br> <strike> (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strike><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" ></li></li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Race is consistently the most statistically significant variable in the location of commercial hazardous waste facilities. Three of the five largest commercial hazardous waste landfills in the United States are located in communities of color; communities with commercial hazardous waste facilities have two to three times the average minority population of communities without such facilities; and three out of every five African Americans and Hispanic North Americans live in communities with toxic waste sites.</sub><sup><strike> 1</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;The predominantly African American and Hispanic south side of Chicago has the greatest concentration of hazardous waste sites in the United States.</strike>&nbsp; <font COLOR="#000000"><b>The African American community of Mossville in rural Louisiana is home to over thirty petrochemical and industrial plants located within a two-mile area. A US government report in 1999 highlighted alarming levels of dioxin in the blood of the residents and linked those levels to local exposures.</b><strike> <br> </font></ul></ul></ul></ul><font COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)</strike>&nbsp; <br></font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" ></li></li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Communities where hazardous waste incinerators are sited tend to have large minority populations, low incomes, and low property values. The minority portion of the population in communities with existing incinerat<b>ors</b><strike> ions</strike>&nbsp;is 98 percent higher than the national average. In Houston, Texas, six of eight municipal incinerators are located in predominantly African American neighborhoods.</sub><sup><strike> 2</sup></sub><br> </CENTER> (3) <br></font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" ><ul></li></li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Communities of color have greater cancer rates than white communities.</sub><sup>3</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many environmental groups are calling for a study of the linkage between environmental contamination and increased cancer rates<font COLOR="#000000">.</strike>&nbsp; <b>The<font COLOR="#0000ff">&nbsp; <font COLOR="#000000">asthma rate among African American children is 26 higher than that among white children. (US CDC) In 2002, 71% of African Americans live in counties that violate federal clean air standards compared with 58% of whites. <br> </font></ul></ul></ul></ul></b><strike><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)</strike>&nbsp; <br> </font></strike></strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" ></li></li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Fifty percent of the children in the United States suffering from lead poisoning are African American. <b>At every income level, black children are contaminated with lead at twice the rate of white children.</b><br> </font></ul></ul></ul></ul><strike><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)</strike>&nbsp; <br> </font></strike></strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" ></li></li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Farm workers&rsquo; children (mainly Hispanics) in the United States suffer a higher rate of birth defects due to their mothers&rsquo; exposure to pesticides during the early stages of pregnancy. In farm worker communities, children with cancer are common. Pesticide exposure among farm workers <strike> causes more than 300,000 pesticide-related illnesses each year.</sub><sup>4</sup></sub></strike>&nbsp; <b>can result in death, birth defects, cancer, nerve disorders, skin diseases, and other health complications.</b><strike> <br> </CENTER> (6)</strike>&nbsp; <br></font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" ><ul></li></li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Navajo teenagers have cancer rates seventeen times the national average, due to countless uranium spills on Navajo lands that contaminated their water, air, and soil.</sub><sup>5</sup></sub><br> </font></ul></ul></ul></ul><strike><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></strike></strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" ></li></li><font FACE="Times New Roman">The growing trend during the 1980s and 1990s has been to dump toxic wastes in developing countries.</sub><sup>6</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries such as Liberia have been offered much-needed foreign capital if they accepted several shipments of toxic wastes in the past few years.</strike>&nbsp; <b>Globalization has enabled environmental racism around the world, with developed countries increasingly looking to developing countries as new dumping grounds for unwanted and often toxic wastes.</b> Unfortunately, these countries often lack the appropriate infrastructure to adequately handle the environmental and health problems that accompany these wastes. <br> </font></ul></ul></ul></ul><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the evidence of environmental racism has grown, so has the number of grassroots &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; activists committed to environmental justice. In 1991, the First National People of Color &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environmental Leadership Summit gathered activists from across the country and around &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the world to share stories, strategies, struggles, and victories. The summit produced &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; principles of environmental justice and a challenge to the mainstream, mostly white, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; environmental groups who were found to be exclusionary in both their composition and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; policies. A decade later, hundreds of activists gathered for a second summit to evaluate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; progress and develop strategies for continued work to combat persistent environmental &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; racism.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to the demands of the environmental justice community, the Environmental &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection Agency established the Office of Environmental Equity (later changed to Office &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Environmental Justice) to address inequities in environmental protection. In 1994, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898 requiring federal agencies to develop &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strategies for ensuring compliance with principles of environmental justice. <br> </b><strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></strike> , with a commitment that all communities have the right to safe and healthy environments.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <strike> This</strike>&nbsp; <b>The continued </b>pattern of <b>environmental </b>racism represents a serious challenge to the conscience of all Christians. We <b>therefore </b>ask our local churches, conferences, and general agencies to join with other religious bodies and groups in actions to end this form of racism: <br> (1) We request the Council of Bishops to address environmental racism in any formal communication to the denomination concerning racism or the environment. <br> (2) We urge annual conferences, districts, local churches, and general agencies to become more involved with community groups working to alleviate environmental racism. <br> (3) We urge all general program agencies and the General Commission on Religion and Race to: <br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" >(a) -disseminate the &ldquo;stories&rdquo; of people and communities affected by environmental racism; <br> (b) -find expertise, build leadership, and develop networks that can help empower people within communities in crisis; and <br> (c) -develop programs that help annual conferences, districts, and local churches respond to these concerns. <br> </font></ul></ul></ul></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" >(4) We call upon the General Board of Church and Society to: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" >(a) -advocate a moratorium on the siting of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities in low-income/people-of-color communities; <br> (b) -advocate comprehensive legislation that remedies these injustices and adequately protects all citizens and the environment; <strike> and</strike> <br> <b>(c) advocate compliance with international agreements including the Basel Convention and Stockholm Convention to prevent the dumping of toxic wastes in developing countries;
