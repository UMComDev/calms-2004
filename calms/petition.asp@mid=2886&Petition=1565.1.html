Through this Fund you <font COLOR="#0000ff">each of us <font COLOR="#000000" >become<font COLOR="#0000ff">s<font COLOR="#000000" >partner with the church&rsquo;s agencies to be in mission and ministry at home and around the world. The effects of World Service ministry are making a difference across the globe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> World Service is God&rsquo;s people reaching out in love and compassion in the name of Christ. It represents a call and a challenge to each United Methodist. As <i>The Book of Discipline 2000</i> states, the full payment of the World Service Fund is each congregation&rsquo;s &ldquo;first benevolent responsibility&rdquo; (�812). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >General Observations <br> </font></b></b></CENTER></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >This quadrennium has been a challenge for local churches, annual conferences and the general agencies as each dealt with the effects of September 11, wars, the world economy, the steep decline in the value of investments, instability within the U.S. stock market, spend down of reserves and double digit increases in health care costs. The local churches and annual conferences have struggled to meet their fixed and missional needs while remaining faithful to their connectional covenant. The general agencies have faced those same challenges and have made tough decisions adjusting their budgets in light of those realities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >World Service Fixed Charges</b><br> </font></b></b></CENTER><b><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >General Council on Finance and Administration</b></i>. The Council is accountable to The United Methodist Church through the General Conference for receiving, disbursing, and reporting all general funds. This line item is an estimate of the World Service Fund&rsquo;s share of the Council&rsquo;s expenses for the quadrennium. The Council also receives income from an allocation in the General Administration Fund, and earnings on invested funds. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>Interpretation Resources</b></i>. Along with producing materials to interpret United Methodism&rsquo;s connectional funds, the Marketing Team of United Methodist Communications (UMCom) uses money from this section of the budget for &ldquo;Promotion of Giving,&rdquo; a joint effort of United Methodist Communications, the GCFA, the General Board of Discipleship (GBOD) and the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry (GBHEM). The &ldquo;Promotion of Giving&rdquo; goal is to develop comprehensive financial stewardship tools, leading to improved financial support of ministry at all levels of the connection. &ldquo;Promotion of Giving&rdquo; resources are financed with promotional money set aside from each of the denomination&rsquo;s eight apportioned funds. <br> </font></b></b></i></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" ><br> </font><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >Program Agencies</b><br> </font></b></b></CENTER><CENTER><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" ><b> </font></CENTER></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >The World Service Fund provides basic financial operating resources to four general program boards, four general commissions, and one organization.

This action allowed the general church budget growth to be minimized while maximizing resources forcontinuing orministries. During the 2005-2008 quadrennium, <font COLOR="#0000ff">reserves are not available for operating budgets and benefit trust<font COLOR="#000000" ><font COLOR="#0000ff">is greatly <font COLOR="#000000" >reduced<font COLOR="#0000ff">.<font COLOR="#000000" >these additional income streams will be available at greatly reduced amounts or not at all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The $222 million proposal for the program agencies represents an actual operational increase of 2%. The losses of reserve funds and benefit trust, cited above, are also accounted for in the World Service proposal. When adopted, the World Service apportionment for the general agencies will have increased only 8.03% over four quadrennia - sixteen years.<br> <font COLOR="#000000" ><br> During the budgeting process, presentations by the General Council on Ministries and the program agencies convinced the Council that 1) general church ministry would be severely eroded unless World Service funding for 2005-2008 increased substantially and 2) general agency executive staff have the vision, desire and skills required to reshape denominational ministry in exciting ways. The Council challenged the agencies to further develop their plans for efficiency and effectiveness in ministry. The agencies have proposed several actions in response to that challenge, including but not limited to the following: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" ></li></li></li><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Reductions in the number of meetings and size of some boards of directors. <br> <ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Designating the General Board of Global Ministries to coordinate work in the central conferences while continuing to affirm the work of the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry with educational institutions outside the United States. <br> </font></li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></li></li><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Work toward the deployment of collaborative and/or use designated local field staff in the geographic regions of the central conferences, as well as the possibility of shared staff in the United States. <br> <ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Holding meetings in common venues to maximize cost savings and engender increased collaboration. </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Creation of a new young peoples division within the General Board of Discipleship, effectively reducing the number of units by one. </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Coordinate the scholarships and internships presently administered by several agencies. </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Negotiate joint contracts for goods and services such as telephone, office equipment and supplies, etc., for agencies in Nashville, New York and Washington, D.C., to gain economies of scale. </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Explore the contracting of a common travel agency for use by all of the general program agencies. <br> </font></li></li></li></li></li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Challenges and changes will continue during the 2005-2008 quadrennium as agencies <font COLOR="#0000ff">address <font COLOR="#000000" >urgent priorities within the denomination such as clergy recruitment, deepening spirituality and the increasingly global nature of the church. <br> <u><i><br> </u></i>We believe the agencies have made and continue to make visible improvements in organization and administration.

Funding for several salary and pension assistance programs as described in this report are combined in this item. Over the past two quadrennia GCFA, working with the GBOPHB and GBGM, has sought alternatives to funding these unfunded liabilities. Last quadrennium we cared for the Oklahoma Indian Missionary Conference pre-1982 unfunded liability and this quadrennium we have used resources to fund the General Church Retirement Allowance and the Cuba Service I, eliminating the need for these items to be a claim on the World Service Fund. GCFA is committed to developing alternatives rather than continuing to fund these items through World Service.
