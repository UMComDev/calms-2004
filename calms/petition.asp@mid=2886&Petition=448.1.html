<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >WHEREAS, in 1994, the United States, with the support of the international community, restored democratically elected government in Haiti and supported it with technical and financial aid; but subsequent elections held in 1997 and 2000 were neither free nor fair, and corruption and violence are now endemic in the country; and <br> WHEREAS, in 2002, 150 political murders and disappearances were recorded, the work in large part of the &ldquo;Organizations Populair&rdquo; (OPs) which are now heavily armed vigilantes allied with leaders of the Lavalas party of President Aristide; and <br> WHEREAS, escalating violence disrupts proper functioning of political, judicial, police and civil institutions so that the majority of the people are denied order and justice, and live in fear; and <br> WHEREAS, violence and lack of stability inhibit economic and commercial activity deepening the level of poverty in Haiti, already the poorest country in the hemisphere; and <br> WHEREAS, thousands of persons have been displaced in Haiti and thousands more have sought refuge in the Dominican Republic, in other countries of the Caribbean, and in the United States; and <br> WHEREAS, the United States, through its ambassador to the Organization of American States, has stated the concern of the United States with the Haitian leadership and with the human rights abuses; and <br> WHEREAS, United States law offers opportunity for asylum for those with a well-founded fear of persecution; and <br> WHEREAS, the United States has seen fit to view Haitian refugees as economic migrants and, therefore, not eligible for asylum, and Haiti alone has been subject to an interdiction policy whereby the U.S. Coast Guard turns back refugee boats on the high seas with no offer of protection such as is offered to both interdicted Chinese and Cubans; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> WHEREAS, until December 2002, all asylum seekers arriving in Florida by sea were allowed to remain with family or friends during their asylum application process with the exception of Haitians, all of whom were detained; and <br> WHEREAS, Haitian families who are detained have been separated, the women and men have been placed for months in deplorable conditions in jails alongside criminals, and others (including small children) have been held in overcrowded&nbsp;&nbsp;hotels unsuitable for detention, without exercise or fresh air; and <br> WHEREAS, when a boat filled with refugees reached shore in Miami, they were eligible for parole from detention on bond, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (now the Bureau for Customs and Border Control of the Department of Homeland Security), using the authority granted it since 9/11, obtained a stay on bonds granted to Haitians on grounds of &ldquo;security risk;&rdquo; and <br> WHEREAS, the 200 Haitians who arrived in Miami, December 2002, were given expedited hearings of 30 minutes (including translation time) for their asylum cases with no opportunity to consult with their attorneys, and most now await deportation; and <br> WHEREAS, the U.S., in denying Haitians a full and fair hearing and deporting them, is putting them at great risk on their return; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, the U.S., in subjecting Haitian asylum seekers to interdiction, summary return, expedited removal, prolonged detention and fast-track asylum adjudications, violates U.S. obligations under the Geneva Convention of 1951 and of U.S. asylum law; and <br> WHEREAS, the U.S., which by its own admission is detaining Haitian asylum seekers in order to deter a mass exodus from Haiti, is both applying an inhumane policy which is contrary to international law and applying it in a discriminatory fashion; <br> <i>Therefore</i>, the United Methodist Committee on Relief, in cooperation with other appropriate structures of The United Methodist Church: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> A. Calls upon the Government of the United States to: <br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; End the practice of interdiction of Haitian refugees and make provision instead for a full and fair opportunity for those who have a credible fear to present it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; End the practice of detaining Haitian asylum seekers without parole and/or returning them, and instead to provide for their parole in the same way as the (former) Miami INS District provided for parole of asylum seekers of other nationalities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Grant Haitian asylum seekers full access to refugee determination proceedings and offer protection to those who qualify. <br> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which would allow Haitians who had arrived in the country prior to the date announced for the start of the TPS period, to remain in the U.S. legally until the political situation in Haiti improves. <br> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase resettlement opportunities for Haitian refugees. <br> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitor conditions of return for rejected refugees. <br> 7. Take the leadership in calling for the Organization of American States (OAS), especially the countries of the Caribbean, to develop a policy for Haitian refugees in which the U.S. assumes its share of the responsibility for their protection. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> B. Calls upon the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to: <br> 1. Place an international staff person in the Dominican Republic to respond to the asylum seekers already there, and to provide an existing presence given a possible increased exodus from Haiti. <br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase this presence so as to be able to meet the needs of refugees and asylum seekers in the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Work with the United States government to implement a more just policy for Haitian refugees that will conform with U.S. asylum law, as well as international law.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> C. Calls upon The United Methodist Church through its boards and agencies to: <br> 1. Advocate for an end to the discriminatory treatment of Haitian refugees that runs counter to the laws of the United States and of the international community. <br> 2. Involve itself in the coalition of national organizations which is in process of formation under the leadership of Church World Service and which will advocate for Haitian refugees. <br> 3. Monitor government actions with respect to Haitian asylum seekers and be ready to respond in advocacy to them. <br> 4. Work to establish ministries of hospitality and development for Haitian refugees.</b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> </font></b></b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
