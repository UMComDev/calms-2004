<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Amend ¶162.J as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>J) Alcohol and Other Drugs</i>-We affirm our long-standing support of abstinence from alcohol as a faithful witness to God&rsquo;s liberating and redeeming love for persons. <b>We extend this affirmation to those who choose to consume alcoholic beverages, with the full recognition that such consumption requires awareness of potential effects and risks, necessary caution and discernment, deliberate and intentional restraint, which we are called by Scripture to exercise on other life issues. We urge abstinence for all persons under the age of 21, consistent with existing law, as well as for persons in recovery from alcohol dependence or addiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstinence may also be the only responsible choice in certain situations which presents a risk to health and safety of the person or other persons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the risks and potential consequences are not always known by the person making the decision, we urge inclusion of alcohol in our educational efforts, both in church and society. <br> Since alcohol consumption may very well affect family members and many others, we urge recognition of the context within which drinking occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Distinctions between high-risk use, abuse and addiction should be communicated effectively. We acknowledge that individual behavior is powerfully shaped by one&rsquo;s environment, the rules and regulations of social institutions, community norms, mass media messages, and accessibility of alcohol. To reduce alcohol-related problems, we urge participation in comprehensive, community-wide approaches to prevention.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> A Christian ethic on alcohol that can be supported is one which is consistent with personal, spiritual and societal concern for health, safety, and well-being, an ethic which (a) accepts abstinence in all situations; (b) accepts judicious consumption, with deliberate and intentional restraint, in low-risk situations; (c) actively discourages consumption in high-risk situations; and (d) actively discourages heavy consumption in all situations. <br> We recognize that alcoholism or alcohol dependence is a primary, chronic disease with genetic, psychosocial and environmental factors, as well as spiritual dynamics, that influence its development.&nbsp;&nbsp;This disease is often progressive and fatal.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is characterized by continuous or periodic impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking, most notably denial.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these characteristics has been defined in the professional literature. <br> As members of a community and citizens of a state and nation which allow a product for high potential to be produced, promoted, distributed and valued for routine consumption we are ethically obligated to care about those who succumb to the risks and adverse consequences, especially when those risks and consequences are incompletely understood.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Christians, we are called to put our faith into practice in this area of health, safety and spiritual well-being. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Caring means advocating for a continuum from awareness to prevention to rehabilitation and support in recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources to express this caring should be explored by every congregation.&nbsp;&nbsp;They may be resources available within the church, but we must also extend our faithful witness to the society of which we are a part and the government that we elect to represent us.</b><br> We support abstinence from the use of any illegal drugs. Since the use of <strike> alcohol and </strike> illegal drugs<b>, as well as illegal and problematic use of alcohol, </b> <strike> is</strike>&nbsp; <b>are </b><strike> a</strike>&nbsp;major factor<b>s </b>in crime, disease, death, and family dysfunction, we support educational programs <b>as well as other prevention strategies </b>encouraging abstinence from <b>illegal drug use </b><strike> such use</strike>&nbsp; <b>and, with regard to those who choose to consume alcoholic beverages, judicious use with deliberate and intentional restraint, with Scripture as a guide</b>. <br> Millions of living human beings are testimony to the beneficial consequences of therapeutic drug use, and millions of others are testimony to the detrimental consequences of drug misuse. We encourage wise policies relating to the availability of potentially beneficial or potentially damaging prescription and over-the-counter drugs; we urge that complete information about their use and misuse be readily available to both doctor and patient. We support the strict administration of laws regulating the sale and distribution of <strike> all opiates<b></strike>&nbsp;alcohol and controlled substances</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;We support regulations that protect society from users of drugs of any kind<b>, including alcohol, </b>where it can be shown that a clear and present social danger exists. Drug-dependent persons and their family members<b>, including those who are assessed or diagnosed as dependent on alcohol,</b> are individuals of infinite human worth deserving of treatment, rehabilitation, and ongoing life-changing recovery. <strike> Misuse should be viewed as a symptom of underlying disorders for which remedies should be sought. <b></strike>&nbsp;Misuse or abuse may also require intervention, in order to prevent progression into dependence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We commit ourselves to assisting those who <strike> have become dependent<b></strike>&nbsp;suffer from abuse or dependence</b>, and their families, in finding freedom through Jesus Christ and in finding good opportunities for treatment, for ongoing counseling, and for reintegration into society. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
