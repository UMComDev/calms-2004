<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >Amend �225 as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >�<b> 225.</b> <i>Care of Children and Youth</i>-1. Because the redeeming love of God revealed in Jesus Christ extends to all persons....At least one parent or guardian shall be a member of a Christian church; or sponsor(s) or godparent(s) who are members shall <strike> assume the <b></strike> renew their own </b>baptismal vows. They shall be admonished of this obligation and be earnestly exhorted to faithfulness therein. At the time of baptism they shall be informed that the Church, with its Christian education program, will aid them in the Christian nurture of their children. <br>  2. <b>a) </b>The pastor of the church shall, at the time of administering the <strike> S<b></strike> s</b>acrament of <strike> B<b></strike> b</b>aptism, furnish the parent<b>(</b>s<b>),</b> <strike> or</strike>&nbsp;guardian<b>(</b>s<b>), sponsor(s), or godparent(s)</b> of the child who is baptized with a certificate of baptism, which shall also clearly state that the child is now <strike> enrolled as a preparatory</strike>&nbsp; <b>a baptized </b>member in The United Methodist Church. <strike> The pastor shall also admonish members of the congregation of their responsibility for the Christian nurture of the child.</strike>&nbsp; <br> <b>b) </b>The pastor shall be responsible for seeing that the membership secretary adds the full name of the baptized child to the <strike> preparatory</strike>&nbsp;membership <b>record </b><strike> roll of the church</strike> .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>c) </b>When the baptized child lives in a community not served by the pastor who administers the <strike> S<b></strike> s</b>acrament of <strike> B<b></strike> b</b>aptism, the pastor is responsible for <b>contacting in advance (where possible) and </b>reporting the baptism to a pastor <b>and/</b>or district superintendent who serves in the area where the baptized child lives<b>.</b> <strike> in order that the child&rsquo;s name might be properly entered on the preparatory membership roll. (See � 223.)</strike>&nbsp; <b>The pastor administering the sacrament shall then be responsible for reporting in writing to that pastor or district superintendent the child&rsquo;s name to be entered on the record of a church in that location. <br> d) A pastor of a church who receives notification of a baptism administered elsewhere shall be responsible for entering the required information on that church&rsquo;s record and for notifying the pastor who administered the baptism that the child has been received by transfer. When the pastor of the church in which the child is baptized receives written confirmation that the child&rsquo;s name has been entered on the membership record of another church, a notation may be made on the record of the church where the sacrament was administered that the child has been transferred to another church. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >e) The pastor shall, at the time of administering the sacrament of baptism and at other appropriate times, admonish members of the congregation of their responsibility for the Christian nurture of the child.</b><br> 3. <strike> The pastor shall keep and transmit to the succeeding pastor an accurate register of the names of all baptized children in the charge, including both those who have been baptized there and those who have been baptized elsewhere. This register of baptized children shall serve as the list of preparatory members for whom the congregation has ongoing responsibility for nurture in the life of discipleship until they become full members and accept God&rsquo;s grace for themselves. It shall give the full name of the child, the date of birth, the date and place of baptism, the names of the parent(s) or guardian(s) and their place of residence and phone number, and the names of the sponsor(s) or godparent(s).</strike>&nbsp; <b>The pastor or membership secretary shall regularly review the membership record to identify those who have not become professing members, for purposes of nurturing them toward profession of faith. The number of people so identified shall be reported annually, or at such other times as may be requested, to the charge conference or the annual conference. The congregation has ongoing responsibility to nurture baptized children, youth, and adults in the life of discipleship until they become professing members and accept God's grace for themselves.</b><br> 4. It shall be the duty of the pastor, the parent(s), guardian(s), sponsor(s), or godparent(s), the officers and teachers of the church school, and all members of the congregation to provide training for the children of the Church throughout their childhood that will lead to a personal commitment to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior<strike> ,</strike>&nbsp; <b>and </b>to an understanding of the Christian faith<strike> ,</strike>&nbsp;and <strike> to an appreciation of the privileges and obligations</strike>&nbsp; <b>the meaning </b>of baptism <strike> and membership</strike> . The pastor shall, <b>at least annually, </b>building on the preparation that youth have received throughout their childhood, organize them into classes <strike> for membership and confirmation (� <font FACE="Arial">5<font FACE="Times New Roman">)</strike>&nbsp; <b>to the end that they may profess their faith and be <font COLOR="#000000">confirmed (reference to new paragraph after � 214 and new paragraph before � 216 as proposed by GBOD)</b><font COLOR="#000000" >. This instruction shall be based on materials that the youth have already used and on other resources produced by The United Methodist Church for <strike> the</strike>&nbsp; <b>this </b>purpose <strike> of confirmation preparation</strike> . When youth so prepared shall give evidence of their own Christian faith <strike> and purpose,</strike>&nbsp;and understanding of the <strike> privileges and obligations</strike>&nbsp; <b>meaning and practice </b>of membership, they may be received as <strike> full</strike>&nbsp; <b>professing </b>members. <br> 5. Youth who are members of the Church have all rights and responsibilities of membership within the baptismal covenant. (<i>See</i> _� 255.2.) It is strongly recommended that each local church offer for all senior high youth <strike> who are members of the Church an advanced class of</strike>&nbsp; <b>continuing </b>instruction in the meaning of the Christian life and discipleship. It is further recommended that this course, taught by or under the guidance of the pastor<strike> , diaconal minister, certified Christian educator, youth worker, </strike> or other staff<b> or lay person</b>, emphasize the doctrines of The United Methodist Church and the nature and mission of the Church, leading to continued growth in the knowledge, grace, and service of our Lord Jesus Christ. It shall be the responsibility of the pastor to participate in the growth process through interaction and ministry with youth. <br> <strike> 6. All children shall continually be nurtured as they grow in ability to profess their faith in God and Jesus Christ.</strike> <br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" >
