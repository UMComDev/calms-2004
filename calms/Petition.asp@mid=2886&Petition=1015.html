When not set forth in that Section, capitalized terms have the meanings set forth in predecessor plans or the meanings given to them in the Discipline or a dictionary of general usage.<b><br> A1.2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>History.</b> Although the Program bears a different name, it is an amendment and restatement of SRBP, effective January 1, 2007, as approved by General Conference 2004. SRBP has been frozen as of December 31, 2006 and has been preserved in Supplement Two hereto except to the extent that benefits have been transferred to the Program as provided in Supplement Two. General Conference authorized the establishment of the original predecessor of the Program, USPF, effective January 1, 1974. USPF was a defined benefit plan that was partially frozen and merged into SPP, effective January 1, 1985, at the direction of General Conference. SPP was a defined contribution plan that preserved USPF as supplement one to SPP. Effective January 1, 1993, General Conference directed that SPP be amended and restated as SRBP, and participants with a USPF benefit were given the option of retaining benefits measured by one of two defined benefit formulas or converting their defined benefit accrued benefits into an equivalent lump sum that would be added to their SRBP account balance. Those participants who retained the USPF defined benefit accrued benefit were covered in supplement one to SRBP. Effective January 1, 1998, General Conference authorized the amendment of SRBP to move participant contributions to another plan (the Personal Investment Plan), leaving only General Agency contributions in SRBP. When SRBP was amended and restated as the Program, supplement one to SRBP was amended and restated as Supplement One to the Program and the frozen elements of SRBP were set out as Supplement Two to the Program (which provides for the transfer to the Core Defined Contribution Plan of the frozen SRBP benefits and the later termination of Supplement Two). <br> <b>A1.3</b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></i>The Program.</b> The Program, as approved by General Conference 2004 and as applied to any Plan Sponsor, consists of the following subdivisions, plus any others that may be added to the Program (and minus any subdivisions that may be removed from the Program) from time to time: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part A, also known as the Common Part; <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part B, also known as the Core Defined Benefit Part; <br> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part C, also known as the Core Defined Contribution Part; <br> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplement One, also formerly known as supplement one to SRBP, also known (together with Part A, the Sections of Part B specified in Supplement One as applicable, and the Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor) as USPF; <br> (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplement Two, also formerly known as SRBP; and <br> (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Program will apply to a Participant, a Terminated Participant, a Beneficiary, a Contingent Annuitant, a Recipient, or an Accountholder as of the earlier of the date such person first became eligible for the Program or first had an Accrued Benefit or an Account and will remain applicable, as the Program exists from time to time, until such person no longer has an Accrued Benefit or an Account under the Program. If any issue under the Program applies after such person&rsquo;s Accrued Benefit has been paid or Account has been distributed, then the terms of the Program as they existed on the date of such payment or distribution will apply to such person. In the case of a Beneficiary or any other person who does not have an Accrued Benefit or an Account according to Program records, but who claims a benefit under the Program, the terms of the Program as they existed at the time or times such person would have been entitled to an Accrued Benefit or an Account if such claim were upheld will govern. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >A1.4</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Plans.</b><br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purpose of the nomenclature of the Program, there are four Plans within the Program: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Core Defined Benefit Plan, which is comprised of Parts A and B and the Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor; <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Core Defined Contribution Plan, which is comprised of Parts A and C and the Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor; <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USPF, which is comprised of Part A, the Sections of Part B specified in Supplement One as applicable, Supplement One, and the Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor; and <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SRBP, which is comprised of Part A, Supplement Two, and the Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Core Defined Benefit Plan and the Core Defined Contribution Plan are active Plans. USPF is frozen as to further Service, but benefits accrued by Participants may be increased in accordance with increases in USPF Compensation and the Consumer Price Index as provided in Supplement One. SRBP is a frozen Plan as to all Participants and other Accountholders as of December 31, 2006, with its benefits thereupon being transferred to the Core Defined Benefit Plan and/or the Core Defined Contribution Plan as further described in Section S2.2.1. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purpose of separate funding, there are three plans within the Program: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Consolidated DB Plan; <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Core Defined Contribution Plan; and <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SRBP, but only before its assets have been transferred to the Core Defined Benefit Plan and/or the Core Defined Contribution Plan. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets for each of these three plans will be separately accounted for in the Trust and will not be commingled or transferred except as otherwise specifically provided in the Program. Assets from one of these plans will not be used to fund another of these plans (except as otherwise specifically provided in the Program). Each of these three plans will be treated as a separate single plan within the meaning of Regulation �1.414(l)-1(b)(1). Separate accounting in USPF for certain purposes described in Supplement One will not prevent USPF assets from being available to pay Core DB Plan benefits and vice versa if necessary. Within each plan there may be further separate accounting by Plan Sponsor, and asset commingling among Plan Sponsors may be limited as otherwise provided in the Program. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >A1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type of Plans.</b> Each of the plans listed in Section A1.4(c) is intended to be a program of one or more church-sponsored retirement income accounts within the meaning of Code �403(b)(9), with the Consolidated DB Plan being a defined benefit plan, as that term is defined in Code �414(j), and the plans listed in Sections A1.4(c)(ii) and (iii) being defined contribution plans, as that term is defined in Code �414(i). The Consolidated DB Plan is a grandfathered pre-August 14, 1982 defined benefit Code �403(b) plan under Code �403(b)(9) in accordance with the House-Senate Conference Committee Agreement provisions of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. For the purpose of Code �401(a)(4), the Program is intended to be a multiple employer plan involving more than one Plan Sponsor. Plan Sponsors may or may not be Affiliates of one another. For the purpose of Code �414(e), the Plan Sponsors are each intended to be a church, a convention or association of churches (within the meaning of Code �414(e)(3)(C)), or an organization controlled by or associated with a church or a convention or association of churches (within the meaning of Code �414(e)(3)(D). Accordingly, the Plan Sponsors are intended to be one employer solely for the purpose of Code �414(e) (and separate employers for other purposes, except as may otherwise be specifically provided in the Program). Further, the Program is intended to meet the requirements of a &ldquo;church plan&rdquo; as that term is defined in Code �414(e) and ERISA �3(33) and to be exempt from ERISA as a Church Plan to the extent permitted under Code �410(d), applicable ERISA sections (including, but not limited to, ERISA ¶¶4(b)(2) and 4021(b)(3)), and any other applicable law. <br> <b>A1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Funding.</b> Contributions to fund the benefits provided under the Program are made by the Plan Sponsors as provided in each Plan. <br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Trust</i>. To receive such Contributions, the General Board has established the Trust pursuant to the Trust Agreement. All benefits under the Program will be provided exclusively by distributions from the Trust. The Trustee has the powers and duties specified in the Trust Agreement. The General Board has the authority to replace the Trustee of the Trust at any time, or to establish additional Trusts to fund benefits under the Program. <br> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Insurance Contracts</i>. Benefits under the Program may also, at the General Board&rsquo;s discretion, be provided by the purchase of insurance contracts, and, in such event, the term Trust will also include the Program&rsquo;s interest, if any, in such insurance contracts.

A Participant or Terminated Participant is related to a Plan Sponsor to the extent that he or she performed services for that Plan Sponsor, and a Beneficiary, Contingent Annuitant, or other person entitled to Consolidated DB Plan benefits is related to a Plan Sponsor to the extent that such person is entitled to a benefit through a Participant or Terminated Participant who performed services for that Plan Sponsor. The funding for each constituent subplan of the Consolidated DB Plan will be accomplished as provided in Part B and Supplement One by each Plan Sponsor making Contributions to its Funding Account, which will serve to pay all benefits due from that Plan Sponsor under the Consolidated DB Plan, except as provided in Section A1.6(d)(ii). Subject to any rules or limitations established by the Plan Administrator, all assets in a Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s Funding Account are available to pay all benefits attributable to that Plan Sponsor under the Consolidated DB Plan. <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, a Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor does not have sufficient assets in its Funding Account to pay all benefits of the Consolidated DB Plan as they come due, in order to pay such benefits, the Administrator will authorize periodic debits against the Funding Accounts of all other Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsors (except any such Plan Sponsor with a zero Funding Account balance), pro rata in proportion to the Liabilities each such other Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor has as a percentage of all Liabilities of all Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsors under the Consolidated DB Plan (as determined by the Administrator). If the delinquent Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor later makes contributions to its Funding Account, such contributions will first be allocated pro rata in the same fashion to repay amounts taken from other Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsors&rsquo; Funding Accounts, plus interest at a market rate to be determined by the Administrator from time to time, and only thereafter to the delinquent Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s separate Funding Account. <br> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plan Sponsors that are not Church Funds Agencies will not participate in the sharing of Liabilities or the receipt of funding assistance provided for in Section A1.6(d)(ii). <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Reversion from a Funding Account.</i> No Plan Sponsor may receive a reversion of assets in its Funding Account unless assets remain after all liabilities of that Plan Sponsor to the Consolidated DB Plan have been satisfied as to all Participants, Beneficiaries, and any other persons entitled to benefits under such plan. In the case of Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsors, any such Plan Sponsor may not receive a reversion of assets in its Funding Account unless assets remain after all liabilities of all Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsors to the Consolidated DB Plan have been satisfied as to all Participants, Beneficiaries, and any other persons entitled to benefits under such plan. When all such liabilities have been satisfied by the payment of all benefits due, by annuitizing any remaining benefits with an insurance or annuity provider selected by the Administrator, and/or by converting, merging, or spinning off any remaining benefits to Actuarially Equivalent lump sum or annuity benefits to be paid from another plan or insurance contract, any remaining assets in each Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s Funding Account will be returned by the Trustee to that Plan Sponsor.

The Administrator may not be held responsible for any loss caused by its acting upon any notice, direction, or certification of a Plan Sponsor, a Recipient, an Accountholder, or others, that the Administrator reasonably believes to be genuine and communicated by an authorized person. <br> <b>A3.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indemnification by Plan Sponsors.</b> The Plan Sponsors, jointly and severally, will indemnify the Administrator, the Trustee, and any other person or persons to whom the Plan Sponsor, Trustee, or Administrator has delegated fiduciary or other duties under the Program for, and hold them harmless from and against, any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and all expenses reasonably incurred in their defense if the Plan Sponsors fail to provide such defense) of whatsoever kind and nature that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against them at any time by reason of their service under the Program or the Trust, unless the same is determined to be due to gross negligence, willful misconduct, or willful failure to act. This provision will survive the termination of the Program and the termination of a Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s participation in the Program as to events that occurred while the Plan Sponsor was participating in the Program. <br> <b>A3.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Claims Procedure.</b> The following claims and appeals procedures are subject to any additional rules or procedures that the Administrator may adopt from time to time that are not inconsistent herewith: <br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Filing of Claim</i>.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Recipient or an Accountholder is not required to apply for or begin the receipt of benefits under the Program until his or her Required Beginning Date. Written notice of the disposition of a claim will be sent to the Plan Sponsor and to the Claimant within 45 days after all required forms and materials related to the claim have been filed. If special circumstances require an extension of time, written notice of the extension will be furnished to the Claimant, and written notice of the disposition of a claim will be sent within an additional 90 days. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Denial of Claim. </i>If any claim for benefits under a Plan is wholly or partially denied, the Administrator will send the Claimant written notice of the denial, within the period specified in Section A3.11(a) above, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant, setting forth the following information: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the specific reasons for such denial; <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based; <br> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and <br> (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an explanation of the Program&rsquo;s appeals procedures. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Appeal of Denial. </i>If a Claimant is denied benefits under Section A3.11(b), the Claimant has the right to appeal the decision within 90 days after the date of the claim denial, in accordance with the following procedures: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Intermediary Appeal Procedure</i>.

Such an appeal may be addressed to the Administrator or in care of the person or persons specified in the notice of denial issued under Section A3.11(c)(i). <br> (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A timely filed appeal will be heard by the Final Appeals Committee at its next meeting, unless additional time is needed for processing, in which case the Claimant will be so notified and the appeal will be heard at the following meeting of the Final Appeals Committee. Appeals or documents filed fewer than 30 days before the next meeting of the Final Appeals Committee will not be considered by the Final Appeals Committee except by its leave and discretion. <br> (C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Claimant or a representative of the Plan Sponsor may request permission to appear personally or by teleconference before the Final Appeals Committee to present evidence with respect to the claim, subject to conditions and time limitations set by the Final Appeals Committee, but the expense for any such personal appearance must be borne by the Claimant or the Plan Sponsor. <br> (D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Final Appeals Committee will decide a Claimant&rsquo;s appeal, and its decision will be final. The decision will be implemented by the Administrator. <br> (E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Claimant will be given written notice of the decision on appeal. If the decision is a denial, such notice will include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant, and specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based. Such written notice will be mailed to the claimant by the Administrator within 15 days following the decision by the Final Appeals Committee. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Appeals Committees</i>. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Appeals Intermediary is a committee appointed by the Administrator. <br> (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Final Appeals Committee of the Administrator is a committee of the Board of Directors of the General Board that is selected from time to time by that Board. <br> (C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the Appeals Intermediary and the Final Appeals Committee may develop rules and procedures to govern its own meetings and actions and the filing and decision of claim appeals by Claimants. <br> (D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any failure by either appeals committee to decide a claim appeal by the deadline for such a decision will be deemed a denial of the claim. The Claimant may then proceed to the next step of the procedure. <br> (E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any failure by the Claimant to appeal any claim denial by the deadline for doing so will be deemed to be a final resolution of the claim, and the Claimant will be deemed to have waived his or her right to file an appeal or a further appeal or to pursue any other remedy, including filing a lawsuit. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Appeal a Condition Precedent to Civil Action</i>.

Any such cause of action must be filed with a court of competent jurisdiction within six months of the date on the written notice of denial described in Section A3.11(c)(ii)(E) or such cause of action will be deemed waived, provided, however, that such six-month limit will apply only if it is described in such notice of denial. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A3.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualified Domestic Relations Orders.</b> The provisions of Section A4.2 notwithstanding, all or part of a Participant&rsquo;s Vested benefits arising under this Program may be transferred to one or more Alternate Payees on the basis of a &ldquo;qualified domestic relations order,&rdquo; as that term is defined in Code �414(p), provided that: (1) such order was issued by a court having jurisdiction over the Administrator; or (2) such order was entered by any other court and the Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines that the order is a QDRO. <br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When appropriate, the Administrator will provide a Participant involved in marital litigation with information regarding the nature and value of the Participant&rsquo;s benefits and will assist the Participant and the court in interpreting that information. <br> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Administrator will establish a written procedure to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such qualified orders. Such procedure will provide that during the period in which a determination is being made with respect to the qualified status of an order received by the Administrator and for 30 days thereafter: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Administrator will direct the Trustee to segregate and separately account for any sums payable to the Participant that the order requires to be paid to the Alternate Payee; and <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Participant will be prohibited from electing to receive any distribution that would compromise the rights granted to the Alternate Payee by the order, without the Alternate Payee&rsquo;s written consent. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither the Alternate Payee nor any person claiming through the Alternate Payee will have the right to transfer benefits to another Alternate Payee.

No financial obligations, other than those that can be met by the contributions actually received and the investment results, reduced by any of the Administrator&rsquo;s or Trustee&rsquo;s expenses or charges against the Trust&rsquo;s assets, will be assumed by the Administrator or the Trustee. To the extent that assets of a Plan attributable to a Recipient or an Accountholder have been transferred to a separate dedicated trust, all benefits to which the Recipient or Accountholder is entitled under that Plan will be provided only out of such trust and only to the extent the trust is adequate therefor. Further, if the Trustee segregates Trust assets by Plan within the Program, all benefits to which a Recipient or an Accountholder is entitled under that Plan will be provided only out of such segregated portion of the Trust and only to the extent such segregated portion is adequate therefor. Neither the Administrator, nor the Trustee, nor their officers, employees, contractors, or agents will be personally responsible or otherwise liable for the payment of any benefits hereunder. <br> <b>A4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternative Dispute Resolution.</b> If a dispute arises out of or related to the relationship between any Plan Sponsor and the Administrator or Trustee, the parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation through the American Arbitration Association, or another mediation/arbitration service mutually agreed upon by the parties, before resorting to arbitration.

To the extent that any such rules or benefits are in conflict with the general provisions of the Program, such rules or benefits will supersede the general provisions of the Program as to the persons covered by the Supplement to the extent they are in conflict with such general provisions.

In cases where definitions or other provisions of Parts A, B, and C of the Program do not specifically mention the Puerto Rico Methodist Church, they will be deemed to include appropriate references to comparable rules and procedures of the Puerto Rico Methodist Church and/or the Puerto Rico Methodist Church&rsquo;s equivalent of the Discipline. <br> <b>A4.18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change in Classification.</b> A Clergy Employee may cease to be a Clergyperson or may continue as a Clergyperson but may cease to be Appointed to a ministry with a Plan Sponsor.

Similarly, a Lay Employee may qualify as a Clergyperson or may already be a Clergyperson and may be Appointed to work for a Plan Sponsor. In such case, the Lay Employee will be reclassified as a Clergy Employee. The intent of the Program is to continue to cover Employees who change classification from Clergy Employee to Lay Employee or vice versa without interruption. Benefits will continue to accrue and Contributions will continue to be made.

If, however, a Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor does not have sufficient assets in its Funding Account to pay Plan benefits as they come due, in order to pay such benefits, the Administrator will authorize debits from time to time against the Funding Accounts of all other Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsors (except any Plan Sponsor with a zero Funding Account balance), pro rata in proportion to the Liabilities each such other Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor has as a percentage of all Liabilities under the Plan (as determined by the Administrator) of all Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsors. If the delinquent Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor later makes contributions to the Plan, such contributions will first be allocated pro rata in the same fashion to repay amounts taken from other Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsors, plus interest at a market rate to be determined by the Administrator from time to time, and only thereafter to the delinquent Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s separate Funding Account. Plan Sponsors that are not Church Funds Agencies will not participate in the sharing of Liabilities or the receipt of funding assistance provided for above. <br> (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Reversions.</i> No Plan Sponsor may receive a reversion of assets in its Funding Account unless assets remain after all liabilities of that Plan Sponsor to the Consolidated DB Plan have been satisfied as to all Participants, Beneficiaries, and any other persons entitled to benefits under such plan. In the case of Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsors, any such Plan Sponsor may not receive a reversion of assets in its Funding Account unless assets remain after all liabilities of all Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsors to the Consolidated DB Plan have been satisfied as to all Participants, Beneficiaries, and any other persons entitled to benefits under such plan. When all such liabilities have been satisfied by the payment of all benefits due, by annuitizing any remaining benefits with an insurance or annuity provider selected by the Administrator, and/or by converting, merging, or spinning off any remaining benefits to Actuarially Equivalent lump sum or annuity benefits to be paid from another plan or insurance contract, any remaining assets in each Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s Funding Account will be returned by the Trustee to that Plan Sponsor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, assets may also be returned to a Plan Sponsor as provided in Section A4.3. As provided in the Plan, certain forfeitures may be turned over to the Administrator to pay for the administrative expenses of the Plan. <br> (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>SRBP Annuities</i>. If assets have been transferred from Section S2.2.1(a) to the Core Defined Benefit Plan, they will be credited to the appropriate Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s Funding Account under the Core Defined Benefit Plan as provided in Section S2.2.1(a) and be used to pay the annuities from SRBP already In Pay Status that were transferred from SRBP in accordance with Section S2.2.1(a).

The Administrator may aggregate similar Accounts from more than one Plan in the Program for the purposes of accounting, investment, distributions, and other purposes in accordance with rules and procedures adopted from time to time. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Separate Fund Accounting.</b><br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Manner of Accounting</i>.

If a Participant Relinquishes a benefit, it is forfeited.

The normal form of payment of an Accountholder&rsquo;s benefit is a cash lump-sum distribution equal to the Accountholder&rsquo;s total Account Balance in the Plan valued as of the Accounting Date coincident with or immediately before such distribution, and, except as otherwise provided herein, all benefits will be paid in such form. <br> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Small Account Balance. </i>Except in the case of a Disabled Participant or a Disabled Terminated Participant, if the Accountholder&rsquo;s Account Balance in this Plan at the time of distribution does not exceed $5,000, the entire amount of the Vested Account Balance in the Plan will be distributed as a lump sum to the Accountholder as soon as administratively feasible. A Disabled Participant or a Disabled Terminated Participant must consent to such distribution. <br> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Payment in Cash Installments</i>. In accordance with rules established by the Administrator, an Accountholder may elect to receive his or her Account Balance in this Plan in cash installments. Such installments will be made in a series of distributions, payable annually or at more frequent intervals, determined in accordance with the provisions set forth below and rules issued by the Administrator. The payments will continue until the Accountholder changes his or her distribution option or until the Accountholder&rsquo;s entire Account Balance in the Plan has been distributed. Until such time, income, gains, losses, expenses, and unrealized appreciation or depreciation will continue to be allocated to the Account in accordance with Section C6. All payments of cash installments will be subject to the following. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When required by Code �401(a)(9), the amount distributed in each calendar year beginning with the calendar year in which the payment begins will not be less than the Account Balance in this Plan on the last Accounting Date in the preceding calendar year divided by the divisor determined under Regulations issued under Code �401(a)(9). If the first payment is made in the year that includes the last day (April 1) of the Required Beginning Date, such payment will relate to the immediately preceding year, will be computed as though paid in such preceding year, and will be subtracted from the Account Balance in computing the second annual payment, which will be due by December 31 of the same year in which the first payment was made. <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installments may be paid more often than annually, in accordance with rules established by the Administrator, so long as, when required by Code �401(a)(9), the total amount distributed in any year satisfies the minimum distribution requirement of Sections C8.1(c)(i) and C8.4. Distributions in excess of the minimum requirement in any year will not reduce the minimum required distribution in later years. Corrective distributions made to satisfy any of the limitations of Section C5 will not be considered distributions for the purpose of the minimum distribution requirement. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Partial Distributions</i>. An Accountholder may elect one or more partial distributions of his or her Account Balance under the Plan, in accordance with rules established by the Administrator, provided that each such distribution is made on or before the required date for such distribution under Section C8.4. <br> (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Election Procedures</i>. Wherever the Plan provides for an Accountholder to elect a form of distribution (including the right to defer receiving a distribution), the Administrator will provide a written explanation of the different forms of distribution. Such explanation will be provided not fewer than 30 nor more than 180 days before the scheduled commencement of such benefit, or within such other period as may be provided by any applicable provision of the Code. An Accountholder who has received such explanation may waive the 30-day period and elect to have his or her benefit distributed immediately. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distributions.</b> The following provisions are subject to Section C8.4 (relating to required minimum distributions). <br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Small Account Balances. </i>Except in the case of a Disabled Participant or a Disabled Terminated Participant, if, at the time of a Participant&rsquo;s Retirement or Termination of Employment, or immediately after an Alternate Payee&rsquo;s benefit is segregated pursuant to a QDRO, such person&rsquo;s Vested Account Balance does not exceed $5,000, the entire amount of the Vested Account Balance will be distributed as a lump sum to the appropriate Accountholder as soon as administratively feasible. A Disabled Participant or a Disabled Terminated Participant must consent to such distribution, which will be made in accordance with Section C8.2(d). <br> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Distribution at</i> <i>Retirement</i>. A Participant with a Vested Account Balance that exceeds $5,000 who attains his or her Early, Normal, or Late Retirement Date may elect to begin receiving the distribution of some or all of his or her Account Balance as soon as administratively feasible thereafter (subject to the limitations of Sections C8.1(e) and C8.2(g)) or he or she will be deemed to have elected to postpone receiving his or her distribution under Section C8.2(e). Such distribution will be made either in the normal form of payment provided in Section C8.1(a) or, if the Participant so elects, in any optional form of payment provided under Section C8.1. <br> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Distribution at</i> <i>Termination of Employment</i>. A Participant with a Vested Account Balance that exceeds $5,000: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who is a Clergy Employee and who incurs both a Termination of Employment and a Termination of Conference Relationship; or <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who is a Lay Employee and who incurs a Termination of Employment, <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may elect to begin receiving the distribution of some or all of his or her Account Balance as soon as administratively feasible thereafter (subject to the limitations of Sections C8.1(e) and C8.2(g)) or he or she will be deemed to have elected to postpone receiving his or her distribution until a date not later than the latest date determined under Section C8.2(f).

Such distribution will be made either in the normal form provided in Section C8.1(a) or, if the Participant so elects, in any optional form provided by Section C8.1. <br> (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Delayed Distribution</i>. A Participant who has deferred the Distribution of some or all of his or her Accounts under the Plan under Sections C8.2(b)-(d) may elect to receive some or all of his or her remaining Accounts under the Plan at any later time (subject to the limitations of Sections C8.1(e) and C8.2(g), but not later than the date specified in Section C8.2(f)) in any optional form provided by Section C8.1. <br> (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Latest Commencement Date.</i> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the latest date upon which the distribution of a Participant&rsquo;s Account under the Plan may begin is the Required Beginning Date. Periodic distributions, including mandatory partial lump sum distributions, will be required thereafter as provided in Section C8.4. <br> (g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tax Notice</i>. Before making any Eligible Rollover Distribution, the Administrator will furnish each Accountholder with a notice describing his or her right to a direct rollover of the distribution and the tax consequences of the distribution. Such notice will be furnished not more than 90 days nor fewer than 30 days before the Recipient is entitled to receive such distribution, and no distribution will be made until 30 days after he or she has received such notice unless he or she waives such 30 day period in writing in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payments After an Accountholder&rsquo;s Death.</b> The following provisions are subject to Section C8.4 (relating to required minimum distributions). <br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Distribution on Death.</i> Upon the death of an Accountholder, all amounts credited to such Accountholder&rsquo;s Account will be distributed to his or her Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of the Plan or as otherwise specified in the Plan. <br> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Proof of Death.</i> The Administrator may require such proper proof of death and such evidence of the right of any person to receive payment of the value of the Account of a deceased Accountholder as the Administrator may deem appropriate. The Administrator&rsquo;s determination of which person will receive payment will be conclusive. <br> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Beneficiary Designation.</i> A Participant may name a Designated Beneficiary in accordance with Section A6. <br> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Surviving Spouse.</i> Notwithstanding a Participant&rsquo;s Beneficiary designation to the contrary, if the deceased Participant&rsquo;s Spouse survives him or her, the Participant&rsquo;s surviving Spouse will be his or her Beneficiary and the Participant&rsquo;s Account will be paid to that Spouse unless: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Spouse consents in writing after the Participant&rsquo;s death, or had consented in writing before the Participant&rsquo;s death, witnessed in either case by a Plan Sponsor or an Administrator representative or a notary public, to the Participant&rsquo;s designation of another Designated Beneficiary. The Spouse must consent as specified above to each change in Designated Beneficiary unless the original consent expressly permits the Participant to further change his or her Designated Beneficiary without the requirement of further consent by the Spouse; <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Participant is legally separated from his or her Spouse or has been abandoned (within the meaning of local law) by his or her Spouse, and, in either case, the Participant has a court order to such effect (and there is no QDRO that provides otherwise); <br> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Spouse Disclaims the Participant&rsquo;s Account, in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator, before receiving it. The Disclaimer must be of the entire benefit. The effect of such Disclaimer is to treat the Spouse as if he or she had predeceased the Participant; or <br> (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither the Participant nor the Administrator can locate the Spouse (provided, however, that the Administrator will have no obligation to search for such Spouse). <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Change of Beneficiary.</i> An Accountholder may at any time revoke his or her designation of a Beneficiary or change his or her Designated Beneficiary by filing written notice (in such form as may be required by the Administrator) of such revocation or change with the Administrator. <br> (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Effect of Divorce.</i> A Participant&rsquo;s divorce on or after January 1, 1998 will automatically revoke any Beneficiary designation in favor of the Participant&rsquo;s Spouse made before the divorce, unless: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a QDRO provides that the divorced former Spouse is to be treated as a Spouse for the purpose of receiving death benefits, or <br> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Participant completes another Beneficiary designation in favor of the former Spouse after the divorce. Until such time as a new designation of Beneficiary is filed with the Administrator in accordance with the provisions of this Section C8.3(f)(ii), benefits will be payable as though the former Spouse had predeceased the Participant. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Death of Participant After Distribution Has Begun. </i>If a Participant dies after the distribution of his or her benefit has begun and after the Required Beginning Date, then distribution will be made to the Participant&rsquo;s Beneficiary under Section C8.3(c) or (d) above under the same method of distribution elected by the Participant (or, if the Beneficiary so elects, an immediate lump sum) over a period at least as rapid as that applicable to the method of distribution elected by the Participant, all in accordance with Code �401(a)(9) and the Regulations thereunder. <br> (h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Death of Participant Before Distribution Has Begun</i>.

USPF was a defined benefit plan that was partially frozen and merged into SPP, effective January 1, 1985, at the direction of General Conference. SPP was a defined contribution plan that preserved USPF as supplement one to SPP. Effective January 1, 1993, General Conference directed that SPP be amended and restated as SRBP, and participants with a USPF benefit not yet In Pay Status were given the option of retaining benefits measured by one of two defined benefit formulas or converting their defined benefit accrued benefits into an equivalent lump sum that would be added to their SRBP account balance. Those participants who retained the USPF defined benefit accrued benefit (including those already In Pay Status under USPF) were covered in supplement one to SRBP. Effective January 1, 1998, General Conference authorized the amendment of SRBP to spin-off participant contributions to another plan (the Personal Investment Plan), leaving only Plan Sponsor contributions in SRBP. General Conference also authorized surplus assets in supplement one to be transferred to the General Agency Benefit Trust of The United Methodist Church to be used for other benefit purposes. When SRBP was amended and restated as the Program, effective January 1, 2007, supplement one to SRBP was amended and restated as Supplement One to the Program. <br> <b>S1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USPF.</b> USPF is now a partially frozen plan consisting of Supplement One, Part A, the Sections of Part B specified in this Supplement One as applicable, and any Adoption Agreement executed by a USPF Plan Sponsor (although USPF Plan Sponsors are not required to execute an Adoption Agreement to be USPF Plan Sponsors). USPF provides only defined benefit plan benefits to USPF Participants, their Contingent Annuitants, and their Beneficiaries. No further accrual of benefits (other than that afforded by increasing USPF Compensation) will be credited under USPF after December 31, 2006, but further Service may accrue for the purpose of vesting in the frozen USPF benefits previously accrued. USPF is part of the Consolidated DB Plan. <br> </font></b></b><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION S1.2 - USPF ELIGIBILITY <br> </b><br> </font></b></b></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" ><br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pension Benefits Eligibility.</b> Pension benefits under USPF are frozen.

As described in Sections A1.4(c) and A1.6(d), however, the assets described in this Section S1.4 are available if needed to pay other benefits due under the Consolidated DB Plan, and assets contributed to pay other benefits under the Consolidated Benefit Plan are available to pay benefits due under Supplement One. <br> <b>S1.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contributions.</b> If the assets in the Consolidated DB Plan are not sufficient, in the Administrator&rsquo;s judgment, to adequately provide for benefits due under the Consolidated DB Plan and its subplans (including Supplement One) in accordance with the Funding Policy for the Consolidated DB Plan, the Plan Sponsors will make Contributions by the Due Date (or Dates) set by the Administrator in amounts that are specified by the Administrator as being due by such date(s). <br> <b>S1.4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investment of Assets.</b> Pending distribution or other use of the assets described in Section S1.4, the Trustee will invest the assets as described in the Trust. <br> </font></b></b><CENTER><b><u><font SIZE="5" FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplement Two <br> to the <br> <center> Retirement Security Program for General Agencies <br> </center></font></b></b></u></u></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></b><font SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000000" ><br> </font><CENTER><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" ><br> </font></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CENTER><b><font SIZE="5" FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000000" >STAFF RETIREMENT BENEFITS PROGRAM <br> </font></b></b></CENTER><CENTER><font SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION S2.1 - THE PLAN <br> </b><br> </font></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" ><br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; History.</b> Effective January 1, 1993, General Conference directed that SPP be amended and restated as SRBP. SRBP was a defined contribution plan for the employees of most General Agencies, and included both employer and employee contributions. Participants with a USPF benefit not yet In Pay Status were given the option of converting their USPF defined benefit accrued benefits into an equivalent lump sum that would be added to their SRBP account balance. Electing participants had their converted benefit contributed from USPF to SRBP following their 1993 or 1994 election. Effective January 1, 1998, General Conference authorized the amendment of SRBP to spin-off participant contributions to another plan (the Personal Investment Plan), leaving only Plan Sponsor contributions in SRBP. When SRBP was amended and restated as the Program, approved by General Conference in 2004, effective January 1, 2007, SRBP was amended and restated as Supplement Two to the Program. <br> <b>S2.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frozen Plan.</b> In connection with the amendment and restatement of SRBP as the Program as of January 1, 2007, SRBP was frozen as of December 31, 2006. All benefits accrued under SRBP through December 31, 2006 that have not already been forfeited as of that date under the terms of SRBP will thereafter be fully Vested. No further contributions will be earned under this Supplement Two after December 31, 2006 for any past, present, or future SRBP Participant, except for contributions due under SRBP relating to periods on or before December 31, 2006.

In the case of SRBP annuity benefits In Pay Status (that have not been previously transferred to a commercial annuity company), the annuities and assets determined by the Administrator to be sufficient to fund such annuities will be transferred from Supplement Two to the Funding Account in the Core Defined Benefit Plan of the appropriate Plan Sponsor(s). Such annuities will thereafter continue to be paid in the same form and amount and to the same payees as was previously the case. The appropriate Plan Sponsor is the Plan Sponsor to which a Participant rendered Service. If a Participant rendered Service to more than one Plan Sponsor, each of which made contributions to SRBP on behalf of such Participant, then the asset transfer will be made to the Funding Accounts of all such Plan Sponsors in proportion to their liabilities to pay such Participant&rsquo;s (or his or her Beneficiary&rsquo;s) annuity. <br> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit Held in an Account</i>. In the case of any part of a Participant&rsquo;s or Accountholder&rsquo;s Final SRBP Account Balance that, as of January 1, 2007, has not yet been distributed to the Participant or other Accountholder, whether or not such Participant or Accountholder was then entitled to a distribution of such Account Balance, such Final SRBP Account Balance will be transferred to the Core Defined Contribution Plan in accordance with Section C4.5. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, because of a Participant&rsquo;s death just before January 1, 2007, or some other circumstance, a timely calculation or transfer of a Final SRBP Account Balance is difficult or impossible, or, when such a transfer, having once been made, later appears not to have been transferred in accordance with Section S2.2.1(a) or (b) in light of later-acquired information or the discovery of an administrative error, then the Administrator will make an equitable correction of the situation with the objective of complying with Section S2.2.1(a) or (b), whichever appears to be applicable. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >S2.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Termination of Plan.</b> Once all the transfers described in Section S2.2.1 are completed, this Supplement Two will automatically terminate and become a nullity except to the extent that it is needed to: <br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help specify the benefit due under another Supplement or another Plan; <br> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cure errors in the computation or determination of benefits due under this Supplement Two or SRBP; or <br> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accept and adjudicate a claim (or appeal) for benefits due under this Supplement Two or SRBP. <br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
