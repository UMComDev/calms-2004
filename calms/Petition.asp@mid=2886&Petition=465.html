<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><font COLOR="#000000">Christians are called to celebrate and protect the worth and dignity of every human being and to struggle against oppression and exploitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are called to &ldquo;proclaim release to the captives ... to set at liberty those who are oppressed&rdquo; (Luke 4:18, RSV). <br> The need for economic development and growth is critically acute in most Native American communities across the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic conditions are appalling, with some reservations facing upwards of 80 percent unemployment and poverty rates at many times the national average.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Native American reservations have the highest poverty rate in America.&nbsp;&nbsp;Health, education, and income statistics are the worst in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is virtually no tax base on many reservations. Equity for investment is practically non-existent, and capital for development is nearly impossible to obtain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some tribes have resorted to gambling enterprises in an effort to transform their economies. The vast majority of tribes remain in desperate need of meaningful, diversified economic development. <br> Economic development encompasses everything from job creation to reform in tax codes, from the creation of banking institutions to the expansion of tribal authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of basic physical infrastructure such as roads and sewers, telecommunications to bridge the digital divide, and fiscal literacy development for Native American people must all occur for successful economic development.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> With due recognition of tribal sovereignty and the self-determining aspirations of Native Americans, we affirm economic development as a critical means by which Native American communities will truly be empowered to pursue their own priorities for their people and their lands and the only means to successfully weave tribal economies into the larger economic fabric of the Americas.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate goal of economic development is to create economic self-sufficiency in Native American communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary economic decisions must be made by tribes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tribes must control their own affairs and resources. <br> The U.S. Department of the Interior has grossly mismanaged tribal lands and has lost track of billions of dollars in mining, logging, and other royalties that should have gone to benefit Native American tribes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleaning up the accounting and management of trust funds is critical. <br> The General Conference of The United Methodist Church urges: <br> </font></b></b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United Methodists to support the efforts of sovereign Native American nations to create means and methods of economic development that do not depend on gambling and do not disrupt or destroy sacred sites. <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. government to end its domination and paternalism and work with Native American tribes in a genuine partnership to support economic development and trust reform. <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The General Board of Church and Society and the Native American Comprehensive Plan of The General Board of Global Ministries to cosponsor the Native American Economic Development and Empowerment Task Force. The responsibilities of the task force are to provide ways for United Methodist boards, agencies, and annual conferences to work with Native American tribes on economic development; to develop collaborative models for economic empowerment; to consider convening a summit with socially responsible investors, community development organizations, religious representatives, and government officials on Native American economic development; and to monitor public programs and holding decision-makers accountable. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The General Board of Church and Society to work with the National Congress of American Indians and other Native American organizations in advocating for federal economic development programs and initiatives. <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The General Board of Global Ministries to support funding of economic development projects of Native American tribes. <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Board of Pensions and Health Benefits to invest funds in Native American&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;financial institutions and community organizations such as the First Nations Development&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Institute, the Montana Native American Finance and Development Initiative, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackfeet Reservation Development Fund. </b><br> <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The General Board of Church and Society to facilitate participation of United Methodist&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Native Americans in the work of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issues.</b><font COLOR="#000000" ><br> </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" ><font COLOR="#000000">
