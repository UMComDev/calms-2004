Then your light shall break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall spring up quickly; your vindicator shall go before you, the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard</i> (Isaiah 58:6-8, NRSV). <br> <font FACE="Batang"><br> <center><i><font FACE="Times New Roman">I.

"Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life."</sub><sup>1 <br> <font FACE="Batang"><br> </font></sup></sub><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Although globally enough food is produced to feed everyone, 840 million people are undernourished, 799 million of them in the developing world.

Hunger cannot be dissociated from people and systems that keep people in poverty. <br> </font><font FACE="Batang" SIZE="3" ><br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;<CENTER><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >II. Theological Bases for Action <br> </font></i></i></CENTER></i><font FACE="Batang" SIZE="3" ><br> <font FACE="Times New Roman">The Bible reveals that, from the earliest times, God's faithful community has been concerned about hunger and poverty. Helping those in need was not simply a matter of charity, but of responsibility, righteousness, and justice (Isaiah 58:6-8; Jeremiah 22:3; Matthew 25:31-46). For example, the Israelites were commanded to leave the corners of their fields and the gleanings of harvests for the poor and aliens (Leviticus 19:9-10). Jesus taught that whatever people do to "the least of these," they also do him (Matthew 25:31-46). That Jesus was born to a poor, unmarried woman who was living in a small nation, occupied and oppressed by a mighty foreign empire, concretely reveals God's full identification with poor, powerless, and oppressed people.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <font FACE="Batang"><br> <font FACE="Times New Roman">As Christians, a key question that we must ask ourselves is: What does God require and enable us individually and corporately to do? We know that God loves and cares for all creation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus stressed that the two greatest commandments were to love God and to love our neighbors as ourselves (Matthew 22:34-40). He also challenged the rich young ruler who said he was keeping all of the commandments to sell all of his possessions and give his money to the poor (Matthew 19:16-26). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >In the incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the promise and the first fruits of redemption were brought to sinful and selfish humanity. Jesus&rsquo; own concern for human need in his ministry is a model for the church&rsquo;s concern. His opposition to those who would ignore the needs of the neighbor makes clear that we grossly misunderstand and fail to grasp God&rsquo;s grace if we imagine that God overlooks, condones, or easily tolerates our indifference to the plight of our neighbors, our greed and selfishness, or our systems of injustice and oppression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </font><font FACE="Batang" SIZE="3" ><br> <font FACE="Times New Roman">We believe that God's Holy Spirit continues to move today, re-fashioning lives, tearing down unjust structures, restoring community, and engendering faith, hope, and love. The work of the Holy Spirit impels us to take action, even when perfect solutions are not apparent. We engage in the struggle for bread and justice for all in the confidence that God goes before us and guides us. That struggle includes examination of our personal and congregational lives in the light of God's love and concern for all and Jesus' question, "Who is your neighbor?" <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> As United Methodists, we also look to our ongoing tradition of social concern. Methodism's founder, John Wesley, preached and wrote about the importance of simpler lifestyles. He emphasized ethical stewardship of time, money, and resources as important means to enable ministry with those suffering from hunger and poverty. Wesley preached the gospel to people who were poor, visited them, and lived with them. He donated <i>most</i> of the money that he earned-not just a tithe (ten percent of his income)-to the church and charitable ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Wesley's teachings about ministry and frugal lifestyle stand in stark contrast to today's reality. According to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), 20 percent of the world's people in the highest-income countries account for 86 percent of total private consumption expenditures, whereas the poorest 20 percent account for only 1.3 percent (1998). For example: <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&nbsp;The richest fifth consumes 45 percent of all meat and fish-the poorest fifth, 5 percent. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The richest fifth consumes 58 percent of total energy-the poorest fifth, less than 4 percent. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The richest fifth consumes 84 percent of all paper-the poorest fifth, 1.1 percent. </sub><sup>5</sup></sub><font FACE="Batang"><br> </font><font FACE="Batang" SIZE="3" ><br> <font FACE="Times New Roman">In faithfulness to our understanding of God&rsquo;s good intentions for all peoples, we, as members of The United Methodist Church, set for ourselves, our congregations, institutions, and agencies no lesser goals than repentance for the existence of human hunger and increased commitment to end world hunger and poverty. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;<CENTER><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >III. A Call for United Methodists <br> </font></i></i></CENTER></i><font FACE="Batang" SIZE="3" ><br> <font FACE="Times New Roman">Change is not easy. Movement toward the abolishment of hunger and poverty requires commitment and stamina. All nations, particularly the developed nations, must examine and modify those values, attitudes, and institutions that are the basic causes of poverty and underdevelopment, the primary sources of world and economic hunger. United Methodists must act corporately and individually. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;We call for The United Methodist Church to engage in an educational effort that would provide information about the scale of world and domestic hunger and its causes, and to engage in study and effort to integrate the church's missional programs into a coherent policy with respect to a just, sustainable, and participatory development. <br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;We call for The United Methodist Church to develop effective public policy strategies and educate the constituency on hunger issues, through its appropriate agencies, that would enable church members to participate in efforts to: <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decrease mother/child mortality; <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; promote environmental justice and sustainable practices for using and restoring natural&nbsp;&nbsp;resources; <br> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide safe drinking water and sustainable water-management systems; <br> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; support community organizing to effect change in systems that keep people poor and powerless; <br> (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; organize and work to retain programs such as Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), food stamps, and food co-ops; <br> (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; develop and implement agricultural policies that increase food production on family farms, provide just wages and working conditions for farm workers, and provide incentives for farmers to produce crops using appropriate technology with equitable access to land by all; <br> (g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; become advocates for reduction of military spending and reallocation of resources to programs that provide human services, convert military facilities to provide for civilian needs, and protect and restore the environment; <br> (h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; become advocates of trade policies that alleviate economic disparities between rich and poor countries while protecting labor and human rights; environmental, health, and safety standards; and respecting the need for agricultural and food security; <br> (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protect craftspeople and artisans from exploitative trade practices; and <br> (j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; support community-based economic development that provides jobs; recycles money within communities; provides low-cost, high-quality services to meet basic human needs; and combats unemployment and underemployment. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >3.&nbsp;&nbsp;We specifically call upon each local church, cooperative parish, district, and conference to: <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >(a) increase sharing resources through support of church and community agencies dedicated to eliminating hunger and poverty at home and abroad; <br> (b) become involved in Fair Trade activism through efforts such as purchasing fair trade products from fair trade companies such as SERVV International, asking grocery and specialty stores to carry fair trade coffee and other fair trade items, and participating in UMCOR's Coffee Project. (More ideas are on Global Exchange's web site at: <u>http://www.globalexchange.org)</u>); and <br> (c) promote World Food Day, which is observed on October 16 (see <u>http://www.worldfooddayusa.org</u>) and National Hunger Awareness Day observed on June 5 (see <u>http://www.hungerday.org</u>). <br> </font><font FACE="Batang" SIZE="3" ><br> <font FACE="Times New Roman">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;We call on United Methodists to strive for "Christian perfection" and to recover the Wesleyan tradition of simpler lifestyles and generosity in personal service and financial giving. Therefore, individuals are encouraged to: <br></font><font FACE="Batang" SIZE="3" ><br> <font FACE="Times New Roman">(a) study and discuss John Wesley's sermons (and related scripture passages) that address "acts of mercy" and Christian stewardship, including "The More Excellent Way," "The Use of Money," "On the Danger of Riches," "On the Danger of Increasing Riches," "On Dress," and "On Visiting the Sick;"</sub><sup>8</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> (b) simplify their lifestyles, moving away from consumerism and toward caring; <br> (c) compost, recycle, conserve energy, practice or support organic gardening, and participate in other environment-friendly practices; <br> (d) commit themselves to give more of their time and money to programs that address hunger and poverty, including United Methodist Advance projects and UMCOR's World Hunger/Poverty Advance (#982920); and <br> (e) participate in projects such as "The Souper Bowl of Caring" and Bread for the World's annual "Offering of Letters." <br> </font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> <b>
