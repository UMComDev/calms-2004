</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Amend Resolution 145 as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >145.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suicide: A Challenge to Ministry <br> </font></b></b></CENTER></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The Apostle Paul, rooted in his experience of the resurrected Christ.... <br> For example, victims have been denounced and presumed to be in hell, and families have been stigmatized with guilt and inflicted with economic and social penalties. <br> <b>The purpose of this </b><strike> This</strike>&nbsp;statement is <b>to challenge and </b><strike> intended to be a</strike>&nbsp;guide<b> our caring ministries to reduce the number of suicides and to share </b><strike> and a challenge for United Methodist ministry as it relates to suicide in light of such attitudes and actions by the church. Its purpose is to encourage the sharing of</strike>&nbsp;God&rsquo;s grace <b>so that the lives of those touched by suicide may be enriched, dignified and enabled for ministry to others. </b><strike> in circumstances involving suicide and to offer a word of faith and hope to all who are affected by the tragedy of suicide. <br> <center><i></strike> Demography of Suicide <br> </center></font></CENTER><b></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Suicide if the eleventh leading cause of death claiming 30,000 lives each year or one every 18 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 4,000 0f those who commit suicide annually are under age 25.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because suicide occurs at all ages, it is the fifth leading cause of lost potential life, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it is estimated that between 500 and 1,500 people seek care in emergency rooms each day for suicide attempts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Research indicates that in any given year 20 percent of all high school students seriously consider suicide. <br> Suicide rates vary by age, gender and ethnicity but affects all peoples, regardless of education or socioeconomic status.&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest rate of suicide generally occurs among white males in later life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among some American Indian and Alaskan Native groups, however, rates among youth are several times higher that the U.S. population as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;About 80 percent of those who commit suicide are male, but females are much more likely to attempt suicide.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <b>&ldquo;It is generally agreed that not all deaths that are reported as suicides are reported as such.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deaths may be misclassified as homicides or accidents where individuals have intended suicide by putting themselves in harm&rsquo;s way and lack of evidence does not allow for classifying the death as suicide.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other suicides may be misclassified as accidental or undetermined deaths in deference to community or family.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;(National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, 2001. p.32). <br> </b><strike> Although suicide rates in the United States have remained steady over the past few decades, new phenomena have arisen. Suicide victims in the past were most typically older white males who had suffered loss of family or material security and who may have first turned to the use of alcohol or drugs as a means of escape. <br> The picture is quite different in the 1980s. The rate of suicide among teens and young adults has increased dramatically. There is also a small but noticeable increase in suicide among women and ethnic minorities, as well as a rapid increase among white, male youth. <br> According to data from the National Center for Health Statistics, the annual suicide rate among 15- to 24-year-olds increased 129 percent from 1960 to 1983, from 5.2 to 11.9 suicides per 100,000 youth. During</strike>&nbsp; <strike> 1983, 28,295 Americans took their lives. That&rsquo;s an average of 14 suicides per day, and of these, 5,050 were between the ages of 5 and 24 years old. <br> These official, well-researched reports document circumstances in which there is little doubt about the intent of the victim. The actual number of deaths due to suicide may be twice as high as the reported incidence. <br> Many coroners and medical examiners are reluctant to list suicide as the cause of death because of the stigma attached to it. Listing suicide as the cause of death is further complicated because (1) there is no commonly recognized definition of suicide (one that specifies factors that identify a suicide-caused death-for example, the existence of a note); and (2) families feel the need to mask the death as a traffic fatality, a mixing of lethal combinations of drugs (i.e., alcohol and barbiturates), or other &ldquo;accidents.&rdquo;<br> <u><b></strike> Risk and Protective Factors of Suicide <br> </font></b></b></u><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Specific groups in society appear more vulnerable to suicide than others, especially if they experience certain precipants (events in their lives such as disease, loss of family, friends, job, severe trama, or other stress factors) and have easy access to a method for ending their lives, that is, if they are in an enabling environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies show that 90% of those who die by suicide suffer from a diagnosable mental illness, substance abuse, or both.&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors - vulnerability, precipitating events, enabling environment - must be recognized and addressed if there is to be any reduction to the suicide rate.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Youth experience alienation and rejection by society, family, and the church when dealing with sexual-identity issues, including homosexuality.&nbsp;&nbsp;For many youth, the only perceived way out is suicide. <br> Social interconnections, social support and life skills are shown to provide protection from suicide.&nbsp;&nbsp;These methods can be learned, and youth training, such as that taught annually by the Arkansas Youth Suicide Prevention Commission, is a major force for suicide intervention and prevention. <br> </b><strike> Causes of Suicide <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The Centers for Disease Control of the U.S. Public Health Service has been able to identify causes of many suicides. Specific groups in society appear more <i>vulnerable</i> to suicide than others. People in such groups are at special risk of committing suicide, especially if they experience certain precipitants (events in their lives such as disease, loss of family, friends, job, and so forth) and have access to a method for ending their lives, that is, an <i>enabling environment</i>. These factors-vulnerability, precipitating events, enabling environment-must be recognized and addressed if there is to be any reduction in the suicide rate. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The problem of suicide and suicide attempts is extremely serious in this country. One in five women fall into the vulnerable group, and the female to male rate of suicide completion is about 3.5 to 1. In the past, women have used passive methods to attempt suicide. However, now the enabling environment, in terms of both attitude and access to weaponry, has changed, and the ratios are changing. <br> Youth experience alienation and rejection by society, family, and the church when dealing with sexual-identity issues, including homosexuality. For many youth, the only perceived way out is suicide.</strike> <br> </font><CENTER><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Societal Attitudes <br> </font></i></i></CENTER></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The prevailing attitudes of society, both secular and religious, have been to condemn the victim and ignore the victim&rsquo;s <b>surviving </b>family and friends<strike> , and survivors</strike> . <br> </font>&nbsp; <font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >There are always two parties to a death; ... <br> -Arnold Toynbee, from <i>Man&rsquo;s Concern with Death</i><br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Churches <strike> sometimes</strike>&nbsp;have denied funerals and memorial services to bereaved families. Victims&rsquo; remains have been banned from cemeteries. Medical examiners have falsified records for families so they can receive economic aid. <b>Federal and state surveys of attitudes toward suicide confirm a broad spectrum of responses ranging from fear, denial and resistance to widespread support for suicide prevention.&nbsp;&nbsp;Social and religious stigma is widespread.&nbsp;&nbsp;One report told of a long-time teacher of church youth who lost her son to suicide.&nbsp;&nbsp;When she returned to her class a few weeks later, she was told that because her son had taken his life, she was no longer to teach.&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, several denominations have in recent years adopted informed and more compassionate statement on suicide for their members.&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequently mentioned are the needs to remove social stigmas that discourage youth and others from seeking the help they need and for providing mental health opportunities for those who suffer from depression and suicidal ideation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The understanding support of family and friends as a major factor in providing such effective support is now more widely appreciated. <br> </b><strike> The U.S. Office of the Inspector General conducted a national survey on societal attitudes related to suicide when the teen suicide crisis became evident. The findings of that study, quoted below, provide a picture of these observations and factors related to suicide: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Youth at risk of suicide come from various walks of life and personal experiences. They come from dysfunctional families, as well as loving, supportive families. However, health, educational and social service agencies describe increasing trends in (a) the number of very young (aged ten and under) attempters, (b) suicide ideation (ideas, concern with, sometimes obsession with suicide) among youth of all ages, (c) multiple forms of self-destructive behavior, and (d) a sense of futility among youth. <br> &ldquo;Suicide is the ultimate form of self-destructive behavior. It is a symptom and should not be dealt with in isolation from other self-destructive behaviors or from social, health and educational problems. <br> &ldquo;Community response to suicide ranges from fear, denial and resistance to widespread support for suicide prevention. <br> &ldquo;Many youth who eventually kill themselves never enter the health service system and those who do often drop out prior to completing treatment. This is due, in part, to a stigma associated with mental health problems and suicide. <br> &ldquo;Lack of financial resources or private insurance limits access to mental health treatment. <br> &ldquo;More than half the study respondents cited family problems as contributing factors to suicidal risk. Family support is key to (a) getting youth into treatment, (b) assuring they do not drop out of treatment, and (c) effecting a successful outcome. <br> &ldquo;The most significant gaps in the service system include (a) too few inpatient psychiatric adolescent beds, particularly for public pay patients who, if admitted, are discharged prematurely, (b) limited subacute (non-critical) and alternative living arrangements, including residential treatment, day treatment, group homes and foster care, (c) limited outpatient treatment in community mental health centers where demand is greater than supply, and (d) scarce crisis intervention programs and hotlines with a special focus for youth. <br> &ldquo;Suicide prevention must be community based. School programs are key and should be developed in coordination with existing community resources, including mental health and crisis intervention programs. Networking is crucial to keeping youth from falling through the cracks.&rdquo;<br> <center><i></strike> The Church&rsquo;s Response <br> </center></font></CENTER></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Recognizing that the church&rsquo;s historical response to suicide includes punitive measures intended to prevent suicide and that there is no clear biblical stance on suicide, the General Conference of The United Methodist Church strongly urges the employment of major initiatives to prevent suicide<b>, <font COLOR="#000000">following the guidelines of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention issued by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services</b><font COLOR="#000000" >. Additionally, the General Conference recommends to the boards, agencies, institutions, and local churches of The United Methodist Church that the ministry of suicide prevention should receive urgent attention. <font COLOR="#000000"><b>Survivors of loss through suicide and suicide attempts should also receive priority concern in the overall ministry of the Church.<font COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</b><strike> The families of victims should also receive priority concern in the overall ministry of the Church.</strike>&nbsp;Harsh and punitive measures (such as denial of funeral or memorial services, or ministerial visits) imposed upon families of suicide victims should be denounced and abandoned. The church should participate in and urge others to participate in a full, community-based effort to address the needs of <strike> potential suicide victims</strike>&nbsp; <font COLOR="#000000"><b>people at risk</b><font COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;and their families. Each annual conference and local church should respond to issues of ministry related to suicide prevention and family-support services. <br> It must be emphasized that suicide increases in an environment or society that does not demonstrate a caring attitude toward all persons. The church has a special role in changing societal attitudes and <b>harmful </b><strike> the</strike>&nbsp;social environment<b>s</b> of individuals and families. To promote this effort, the church should do the following: <br> (1) the General Board of Discipleship shall <b>continue to </b>develop curriculum for biblical and theological study of suicide and related mental and environmental health problems and promote the programs recommended by the American Association of Pastoral Counsel<b>ors </b><strike> ing</strike>&nbsp;and the use of <strike> the</strike>&nbsp;scientific research of the Centers for Disease Control <font COLOR="#000000"><b>and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and other credible institutions in the private sector, such as organizations within the National Council of Suicide Prevention</b><font COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;<strike> and the American Association of Suicidology</strike> ; <br> (2) the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry shall develop materials for United Methodist-related seminaries to train church professionals to recognize treatable mental illness associated with suicide (e.g., depression) and to realize when and how to refer persons for treatment; it shall ensure that all pastoral counseling programs include such training and strategies for ministry to <strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">families of suicide victims <font COLOR="#000000"><b></strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">survivors of suicide loss and suicide attempts ; and seek attention to suicide in courses in Bible, Christian Ethics, Preaching and Religious Education as well as Pastoral Care</b>; <br> <font COLOR="#000000" >(3) the General Board of Church and Society shall <b>continue to </b>support public policies that: (a) promote access to mental-health services for all persons regardless of age, (b) remove the stigma associated with mental illness, and (c) encourage &ldquo;help-seeking&rdquo; behavior; <br> (4) embrace all persons affected by suicide<b>, including young children,</b> in loving community through support groups and responsive social institutions, call upon society through the media to reinforce <font COLOR="#000000"><b>(following published guidelines for reporting suicide and related matters)</b><font COLOR="#0000ff">&nbsp; <font COLOR="#000000" >the importance of human life and to advocate that public policies include all persons&rsquo; welfare, and work against policies that devalue human life<b> and perpetuate cultural risk factors</b> (i.e., nuclear armaments, war, <b>racial and ethnic prejudice </b><strike> and so forth</strike> ); <br> (5) affirm that we can destroy our physical bodies but not our being in God, and affirm that a person stands in relationship to others<b>, <font COLOR="#000000">but in our efforts to be more compassionate and care giving, avoid glamorizing the deaths of those who take their lives, especially young people</b>.<font COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;The loss of every person is a loss in community; <br> (6) support the United Methodist childcare institutions that provide treatment for emotionally disturbed children, youth, and their families; <font COLOR="#000000"><b>and retirement communities that are home for those where suicide rates are highest;</b><font COLOR="#0000ff">&nbsp; <font COLOR="#000000" >and <br> (7) strengthen the youth ministries of the local church, helping the young people experience the saving grace of Jesus Christ and participate in the caring fellowship of the church. <br> <center><i>Conclusion <br> </center></font></CENTER></i>&ldquo;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" >The church is called to proclaim the gospel of grace and, in its own life, to embody that gospel.
