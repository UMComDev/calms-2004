<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> <b></i>Report No. 5 <br> </b>Petition Number: <br> <br> <b> REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION FOR THEMES, MISSIONAL PRIORITIES AND <br> SPECIAL PROGRAMS <br> </b><br> The General Council on Ministries recommends two Special Programs, as outlined in Para. 703.10 of <i>The <br> Book of Discipline</i>, 2000. <br> <i>A special program is a quadrennial emphasis initiated by a general program-related <br> agency in accordance with Paras. 906.1, .2, and .4, approved by General Conference and <br> assigned to a general program-related agency. The program shall be designed in <br> response to a distinct opportunity or need in God&rsquo;s world that is evidenced by research <br> or other supporting data and shall propose achievable goals within the quadrennium. <br> Para. 703.10</i>, <i>The Book of Discipline</i>, <i>2000. <br> </i>The two special programs being recommended are: <br> 1. <i>Holistic Strategy on Africa</i>, a special program coordinated by the General Board of Global Ministries <br> (GBGM), in collaboration with several agencies, to be funded at $35,000,000 with funding provided <br> through the participating agencies through their quadrennial budgets. <br> 2. <i>Holistic Strategy on Latin America and the Caribbean</i>, a special program coordinated by the General <br> Board of Global Ministries (GBGM), in collaboration with several agencies, to be funded at <br> $8,000,000, with funding provided through the participating agencies through their quadrennial <br> budgets. <br> Additionally, the General Council on Ministries (GCOM) requests the General Council on Finance and <br> Administration (GCFA) allocate $1,320,000 for the 2005-2008 quadrennium to the General Board of <br> Global Ministries (GBGM) for coordination responsibilities of these two special programs. A description <br> of the special programs follows. <br> <br> <b> Exhibit I <br> Holistic Strategy on Africa <br> Special Program <br> 2005-2008 <br> </b>The mission of The United Methodist Church, as succinctly stated in <i>The Book of Discipline, 2000, </i>is &ldquo;to <br> make disciples of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; <i>(Para 120). <br> </i>Discipleship is the active process of confirming and nurturing the relationship of an individual&rsquo;s life with <br> God in and through Jesus Christ, and becoming a part of the community of discipleship-the Church. It <br> begins with an awareness of the &ldquo;good news&rdquo; and the response to Christ begins a life-long spiritual <br> journey of nurture within the Body of Christ. <br> We find in the New Testament several charges to the church that are foundational to this mission. After <br> Easter, Jesus Christ appears before his bewildered disciples, saying: <i>All authority in heaven and on earth <br> has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the <br> Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have <br> commanded you. And, remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age. (Matthew 28: 19-20). <br> </i>We know that the power of God filled that charge because a small group of unlettered people began the <br> most powerful movement the world has ever known: the Christian church. <br> This missional charge was and is entrusted to the whole church, to all disciples, congregations, and <br> regions. As new communities are added in new places and cultures, the new disciples become full mission <br> partners to be celebrated, confirmed, and nurtured, even as they celebrate, confirm, and nurture those who <br> brought the good news. Thus, older and newer parts of the church are connected in mission. <br> The United Methodist Church can designate one or more special programs for its quadrennial period. This <br> proposal advances the Church in sub-Saharan Africa as a Special Program for the 2005-2008 <br> quadrennium. A description of the Church in that region, its strengths and challenges, and reasons why an <br> emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa is appropriate at this time are outlined. <br> <b>Authority, Discipleship, and Nurture <br> </b>The United Methodist Church in sub-Saharan Africa is totally committed to and involved in the ministry <br> of the church as it calls people to confess their faith in Jesus Christ, become disciples, and observe all that <br> Jesus commands. This is done through a variety of ministries that are supported and nurtured through our <br> connection. <br> The exercise of divine power results in salvation, as exemplified by the ministry of Jesus. He defined his <br> mission as that of seeking and saving the lost (Luke 19:10). He told his critics that he received and ate <br> with sinners (Luke 15:2) because his mission is like that of a sheep-owner who, having lost one sheep, <br> leaves the ninety-nine in the wilderness <i>to go after the one which is lost until he finds him </i>(Luke 15:3-4); <br> or that of a woman who having lost one of her ten silver coins, lights a lamp, sweeps the house; and <br> diligently looks for the lost coin until she finds it (Luke 15:8). And when that which was lost is found, <br> the owner not only rejoices herself but calls her friends and neighbors to rejoice with her. <br> Who are the lost whom Jesus sought? The root sense of the word lost denotes someone or something that <br> is not in its proper place or relationship, as a sheep gone astray, away from the watchful eye of a <br> shepherd, or a coin that is not in its special place of safekeeping. Finding and saving are causes for great <br> rejoicing. <br> Another authoritative text in the salvation story is Acts 1:1-8, an account of the final days of Jesus&rsquo;<br> physical sojourn with the first disciples. After spending forty days with them teaching them about the <br> Kingdom of God, Jesus assured them of his presence and the power of the Holy Spirit. He charged them <br> to be his witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. This story gives <br> the church a clear sense of the scope of our witness and the content. The scope is everywhere, locally <br> (Jerusalem), nearby (Judea), to strangers and foreigners (Samaria), and into the unknown (the end of the <br> earth). The message is Jesus, and his teaching about the Kingdom of God. This is our charge today, given <br> to the whole church, mission everywhere, witnessing to the ultimate victory of God&rsquo;s Kingdom, <br> challenging all of this world&rsquo;s Kingdom, and clearly grounded on the presence and power of the Holy <br> Spirit. <br> Matthew 25 adds another important dimension to mission. This is the charge to respond to the needs of <br> the hungry, the poor, the strangers, the naked, the sick and imprisoned. Jesus&rsquo; ministry includes many <br> examples of feeding, healing, teaching, and comforting the people he encountered. He demonstrated and <br> accepted those around him who seemed to be helpless and abandoned, <i>like sheep without a Shepherd. </i>In <br> telling his followers to minister unto others, he revealed the fullness of his continuing presence with us. <br> <i>Truly, I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to <br> me. </i>(Matthew 25: 40). <br> These charges help us understand the holistic nature of the church. The purpose of the Church in sub- <br> Saharan Africa is to bring people to salvation in Christ, and to change lives positively and permanently <br> for the good of the community. <br> United Methodist disciples in Sub-Saharan Africa are committed to and involved in the evangelistic and <br> humanitarian spectrum we identify with Wesleyan spiritual holiness. Their disciplined life is a product of <br> abundant fruit in faith and deed. Throughout the region, faithful discipleship is a way of life, a holistic <br> ministry concept and response. In caring for the whole person, The United Methodist Church continues to <br> develop and strengthen ministries in evangelism; health; education; economic development for women, <br> children and marginalized people; nutrition, and programs that address issues around HIV/AIDS. <br> <b>The Spirit and Vitality of the Church and Society in Africa <br> </b>To speak of Africa is to speak of social, economic, and political diversity. The continent comprises 53 <br> nations diverse in culture, language, and religion. Diversity is also a hallmark of The United Methodist <br> Church on the continent, where it is present in 21 countries south of the Sahara Desert. <br> To speak of Africa is to speak of vast human and natural resources. The continent has some 625 million <br> people. It provides a large percentage of the world&rsquo;s diamonds, gold, rubber, copper, and oil. The <br> continent is rich in uranium, chromium, and cobalt. <br> To speak of Africa is to speak of a lack of economic development and political stability, of colonial <br> racism, apartheid, neo-colonialism, economic exploitation, and ethnic conflicts. Many nations during the <br> last decade have experienced catastrophic consequences of regional wars; the price of which has been <br> massive loss of lives and an exodus of people resulting in a refugee and displaced population of over 4 <br> million people. <br> To speak of Africa is to speak of famine, floods, drought and disease. The continent has the highest <br> infant immortality rate on earth. Many children die of malnutrition, diarrhea-related diseases, and <br> common childhood ailments for which vaccines exist. <br> The HIV/AIDS pandemic endangers the lives of tens of thousands of people, primarily women, children <br> and young men. One result is an unprecedented orphan population. In a <i>New York Times </i>article on <br> December 20, 2002, Dr. Kofi A. Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, cited the following <br> statistics: <i>2.5 million Africans died from AIDS in 2002 alone</i>, <i>leaving 11 million African children <br> orphaned since the epidemic began. </i>He further cited a United Nations report of November, 2002 <br> showing that 50% of those infected with HIV worldwide are women, while in Africa that figure is 58%. <br> In Dr. Annan&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;<i>Today AIDS has a woman&rsquo;s face</i>.&rdquo;<br> To speak of Africa is to speak of hope, vitality, and determination. It is a continent in trouble but not in <br> despair. Efforts to win freedom from oppression continue and expand. Special government commissions, <br> churches, ecumenical agencies, and non-governmental organizations seek ways to promote peaceful, civil <br> societies. United Methodist bishops in Africa participate in these ecumenical and governmental <br> commissions working on conflict resolution within their countries. <br> Regrettably, both print and electronic media in the United States and Europe far too often focus on the <br> negative images of Africa. Seldom does media provide positive images: the African people&rsquo;s struggle for <br> a better life, children eagerly seeking an education under adverse conditions, and farmers and business <br> men and women striving to draw economic benefits from the rich land. Few Westerners see African <br> women determined to plant and cultivate crops, despite harsh environmental conditions, or governments <br> trying to improve the health services for people. The United Methodist Church in Africa is struggling to <br> provide adequate salary support for its pastors, teachers, and the medical personnel in United Methodist <br> related institutions. These are the stories we need to hear. <br> While the African people are faced with enormous challenges that would discourage and demoralize <br> many, its people still see opportunities. <br> <i>...We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, <br> but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; <br> struck down, but not destroyed;....2 Corinthians 4:8-9. <br> </i>Africans are a people with notable energy, spirit and resourcefulness, and this is nowhere better seen than <br> in The United Methodist Church on the continent of Africa. <br> We begin a new century seeing a phenomenal increase in the numbers of people in Africa accepting Jesus <br> Christ as Lord and Savior. The United Methodist Church membership from western to southern Africa is <br> growing rapidly, not only within the geographical bounds of defined annual conferences, but also beyond <br> their borders to neighboring countries. This blessing places heavy responsibility on the leadership of the <br> churches, increasing the need for trained leaders, clergy and laity. It also requires increased activity to <br> nurture members and empower them in witness and outreach that now defines their discipleship. We need <br> new church buildings in urban and rural areas, and educational materials that are contextually sensitive <br> and language appropriate. With a growing youth population, the church is challenged to develop <br> programs for youth and young adults. The episcopal leadership, clergy, and laity have faithfully...<i>made <br> disciples of Jesus Christ by proclaiming the good news of God&rsquo;s grace . . . (The Book of Discipline </i>2000, <br> Part III, Section I.). <br> The United Methodist Church has a commendable legacy in Africa. Our witness to the wholeness of the <br> Gospel of Jesus Christ served in establishing primary and secondary schools, seminaries, bible colleges, <br> hospitals, and clinics. Most recently, Africa University became the first United Methodist Church-related <br> institution of higher education on the continent. By estimate, 25 % of the presidents of the various <br> nations in Africa were educated in United Methodist primary and secondary schools. In Angola, The <br> United Methodist Church was the first denomination to establish schools for Angolan young people. The <br> first president of Angola, Agostino Neto, was granted a scholarship from The United Methodist Church to <br> study at the Medical Faculty in Lisbon, Portugal. <br> Our Church-related schools have led in the education of women. The Hartford School for Girls in Sierra <br> Leone, which has received support from United Methodist Women, graduated thousands of young <br> women. Hartford graduates work with the United Nations, other non-governmental organizations, and <br> national governments. An example is Ms. Shirley Yema Gbujama, who is Minister of Social Welfare, <br> Gender and Children&rsquo;s Affairs in the Sierra Leone cabinet. She delivered the Laity Address at the 1999 <br> Sierra Leone Annual Conference Session. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mulinguishi, a United <br> Methodist Seminary, has educated much of the leadership of United Methodist clergy in Francophone <br> Africa. <br> The Liberia Annual Conference operates thirty-six educational institutions, including a seminary, a junior <br> college, four senior high schools, and six junior high schools and primary schools. The conference has <br> established an institution of higher education, The United Methodist University of Liberia. Ganta <br> Methodist Hospital is the first hospital established in the northern region of Liberia, the third in the <br> country, and the first in the country to have ongoing leprosy treatment and a prostheses program. The <br> Winifred Harley School of Nursing, also at Ganta, is among the best training institutions for nursing in <br> the region. The words of <i>The Discipline </i>strike home: <i>The purpose of the annual conference it to make <br> disciples of Jesus Christ by equipping its local churches for ministry and by providing a connection for <br> ministry beyond the local church all to the glory of God. </i>(Section IX, para. 601) <br> This legacy continues today as the leadership of The United Methodist Church in Africa is burdened by <br> severe economic hardships and civil conflict, yet still cares for the hungry, the poor, the stranger, the <br> naked, the sick, and the imprisoned. <br> <b>A New Day <br> </b>New issues and opportunities face The United Methodist Church in Africa. Acknowledging problems <br> and vitality, the Council of Bishops in 2000 initiated <i>Hope for the Children of Africa</i>, with the Executive <br> Committee of the Council of Bishops taking an action calling the denomination to develop a <br> comprehensive and holistic strategy for Africa to address critical human needs on the continent, and in <br> particular the needs of The United Methodist Church. <br> Responses to <i>Hope for the Children of Africa </i>within the United States vary. Some congregations and <br> annual conferences have heeded the invitation, assisting with the establishment of orphanages and <br> providing financial and educational resources for schools and clinics serving children. <br> On the general church level, consultations involving the Council of Bishops, general agencies and <br> commissions, the European Commission on Mission, representatives-clergy, lay and episcopal-from <br> Africa have identified ways in which cooperative and connectional ministries are underway as well as <br> assessed future priorities. <br> Cooperative ministries opportunities include: <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">work with annual conferences in developing curriculum for education in <br> the areas of evangelism, liturgy, and worship; <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">training programs for district leaders of youth, district superintendents, and chaplains <br> serving in the army, military and hospitals with a focus on conflict resolution; <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">technical and financial support for institutions of higher education and campus <br> ministries; <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">witness and advocacy, with particular emphases on strong United Nations peacekeeping, a <br> ban on so called &ldquo;conflict diamonds,&rdquo; ratification of the Landmine Ban Treaty, protocol <br> governing child soldiers, reconciliation ministries, debt cancellation, economic development <br> assistance, and funding to attack HIV/AIDS; <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">publication of resource materials such as <i>The Book of Discipline, The Book of <br> Resolution </i>and <i>The Upper Room </i>in French and Hausa, with plans underway to <br> publish a Portuguese edition; <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">community-based primary health care; <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">education and pastoral training in HIV and AIDS ministries; <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">humanitarian assistance and refugee resettlement programs; <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">scholarships, especially for women; <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">annual conference covenant relationships providing funding to supplement pastors <br> salaries; <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">academies for evangelization and church growth in Africa, and <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">support of pastors training schools, seminaries and other institutions designed to <br> train clergy. <br> <b>Challenging The Vision for the 21<font SIZE="1">st <font SIZE="3">Century <br> </b>In September 2002, bishops and lay representatives from Africa, the general secretaries of general <br> agencies, and representatives from the Council of Bishops made the following declaration: <br> <i>We...share a deep and abiding interest in expanding and deepening the <br> effectiveness of the Church&rsquo;s ministry on the continent of Africa. Our desire is to <br> work collaboratively at all levels of The United Methodist Church connection to <br> share an ambitious aspiration for the growth of United Methodist work and <br> witness, while at the same time finding effective, efficient and accountable methods <br> to gain the most benefit from cooperative and coordinated efforts... <br> </i>In keeping with this affirmation, a Special Program on a Holistic Strategy on Africa is proposed for the <br> 2005-2008 quadrennium, the special program to be a collaboration among the Council of Bishops, general <br> secretaries, and general agencies of the church, the European Commission on Mission, and epresentatives <br> from the Africa Central Conferences<b>. <br> Quadrennial Goals and Evaluation <br> </b>The primary goals for the Special Program on Africa are: 1) to assist The United Methodist Church in <br> Africa in strengthening and expanding its witness and ministry on the continent, and 2) to strengthen the <br> connections between with annual conferences of Africa, Europe and the United States in the areas of <br> witness and service, especially in the development of effective models. <br> In this Special Program, the general agencies of The United Methodist Church are committed, as stated in <br> the September 2002 meeting of the Holistic Africa Strategy Meeting,... &ldquo;to work collaboratively at all <br> levels of The United Methodist Church connection....&rdquo;<br> <b>Agency Emphasis <br> </b>The following programs are illustrative of the types of programs to be expanded and/or initiated under the <br> Special Program: <br> <i>1,. Leadership Development and Training and Resources <br> </i>1.1 The General Board of Discipleship (GBOD) plan to support three African, language-specific staff <br> (English, French and Portuguese) who will be responsible for creating and coordinating leadership <br> training events for the formation and development of national leaders, and to provide adjunct staff <br> persons who will plan, prepare, lead and coordinate leadership formation events. These three <br> specialists will be located in west Africa, southern Africa, and the Democratic Republic of Congo <br> providing strategic accessibility to United Methodist Church training in language-specific regions. <br> 1.2 Creation of affordable printed resources. <br> 1.3 Develop lay and clergy leaders as trainers who will offer relevant training events to offer further <br> assistance and information for mutual benefit and learnings. <br> 1.4 Develop user-friendly audio, print and other resources for utilization in local church ministries and <br> programs by working with local church leaders and writers in the creation, translation and crosscultural <br> adaptation of official denominational materials. <br> 1.5 Explore and implement the use of distance training and mentoring through electronic means and <br> Internet. <br> 1.6 The General Commission on United Methodist Men (GCUMM) plan to provide electronic daily <br> devotions for United Methodist Men in Africa.. <br> <i>2. Advocacy <br> </i>2.1 The General Board of Church and Society (GBCS, the Shared Mission Focus on Young People <br> (SMFYP), the General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious Concerns (GCCUIC), and <br> the Council of Bishops (COB) will develop a consolidated educational plan on HIV/AIDS. This will <br> involve the general agencies, annual conferences, districts, and local churches. It may also involve <br> ecumenical organizations, such as the World Council of Churches, and the Ecumenical Advocacy <br> Alliance. <br> 2.2 This initiative will mobilize United Methodists to advocate with United States Congress and the <br> United Nations for adequate policies and funding to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic particularly <br> related to the African continent. <br> 2.3 Use resources (current and newly developed) that provide information on the HIV/AIDS pandemic <br> and suggest ways to become involved. <br> 2.4 Design and implement, in consultation with central conferences in Africa, workshops on HIV/AIDS <br> and how to address the problems. The Democratic Republic of Congo may serve as the initial setting <br> for these workshops. <br> 2.5 In collaboration with the General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious Concerns, The <br> United Methodist Church will continue to work with the World Council of Churches on the Decade to <br> Overcome Violence. <br> <i>3. Evangelism and Church Growth <br> </i>3.1 The General Commission on United Methodist Men will develop electronic daily devotionals for <br> Annual Conferences in Africa, working cooperatively with Radio Africa, a program of the General <br> Board of Global Ministries (GBGM). <br> 3.2 The GBGM will continue its support for landmine removals in Mozambique and Angola. <br> 3.3 GBGM will continue its support for emerging churches in Africa (in Cameroon and Senegal) and will <br> support new church development by annual conferences in Africa. <br> <i>4. Direct Services <br> </i>4.1 At the urging of annual conferences in Africa, GBGM will work toward the revitalization of United <br> Methodist hospitals on the continent. <br> <b>Administration <br> </b>The General Board of Global Ministries (GBGM) will have administrative responsibility for the Special <br> Program. Evaluation will take place under an inter-agency task force composed of representatives of <br> general agencies, the European Commission on Mission, the Council of Bishops, and bishops and lay <br> persons representing the Africa central conferences<b>. <br> Proposed Accountability <br> </b>Reports on the Special Program will be made by the Board of Directors of the General Board of Global <br> Ministries to the Council of Bishops of The United Methodist Church<b>. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Exhibit II <br> Holistic Strategy on Latin America and the Caribbean <br> Special Program <br> 2005-2008 <br> </b><i>Come, you that are blessed ... inherit the kingdom ... for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty <br> and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave <br> me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me. </i>(Matthew 25:34-36) <br> <b>Statement on Latin America and the Caribbean <br> </b>MARCHA (Methodists Associated Representing the Cause of Hispanic Americans) calls upon The <br> United Methodist Church to pay close attention to the critical needs in the Latin America/ Caribbean <br> region and to respond to the missional opportunities that are present there. The United Methodist Church <br> should include in its top priorities missional programs which respond to the growing number of <br> impoverished persons in the Caribbean and Latin America, with women and children being the most <br> affected. The situation in many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean has become extremely <br> critical in recent months. Media headlines attest to the need for urgent attention to these areas. <br> <b>Missional Opportunities <br> </b><br> <b><i>Evangelization</i>: </b>Methodist churches in 19 countries, knit together in mission through the Council of <br> Evangelical Methodist Churches of Latin America and the Caribbean (CIEMAL), are reaching out <br> through new initiatives in evangelization, with significant church growth being experienced in many <br> communities, and with renewed commitment to their Wesleyan heritage of witness with and on behalf of <br> the poor and the oppressed. Twelve new UM congregations have been established in Honduras in the last <br> four years by the General Board of Global Ministries (GBGM). New Methodist congregations have been <br> developed in Colombia, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Venezuela in work under the auspices of CIEMAL <br> with support of GBGM. Church growth could be enhanced if additional resources are provided. <br> <b><i>Prophetic Voice and Accompaniment</i>: </b>The different crises in Latin America and the Caribbean require <br> the prophetic presence of the church helping the people to keep the faith and to seek solutions that would <br> be fair to all. The churches in the region, within their limited resources, are responding to the more <br> immediate needs. They also continue to advocate for justice and the preservation of human rights. The <br> deep and complex relationships between the United States and the different countries in the Latin <br> America/ Caribbean region demand a closer working relationship between the churches in the United <br> States with the churches in the Caribbean and Latin America to amplify our effectiveness in our prophetic <br> witness. <br> <b><i>Health Care</i>: </b>In partnership with United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR), the Methodist <br> churches in collaboration with CIEMAL are engaged in innovative initiatives in comprehensive <br> community-based health care. A recent study revealed that this holistic approach to the total well-being <br> of persons and their environment has impacted the lives of more than 200,000 persons in the last nine <br> years. Ministries with poor and marginalized women are major dimensions of these health programs, <br> involving the well-being of countless thousands of children. These ministries should be strengthened due <br> to their importance. <br> <b><i>Education/Leadership Development</i>: </b>Leadership development is a must within the churches if they are <br> to respond in the name of Christ to the aforementioned needs. There are many persons and church leaders <br> with a good theological education; but, unfortunately, most of the pastors in the emerging churches or <br> those serving rural areas have no formal theological education. The United Methodist Church should <br> assist in the formation of persons in Latin America to enable them to serve their churches and countries in <br> different fields. <br> <b>Social Concerns in the Latin American and Caribbean Region</b>: <br> <b><i>Poverty: </b></i>According to UNICEF statistics, 53 % of the 502 million people of Latin America and the <br> Caribbean live in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than $1 dollar per day per person. Millions of <br> children live on the streets with no place to sleep. They survive by begging or subjecting themselves to <br> inhumane treatment for scraps of food. <br> <b><i>Children and Child Labor</i>: </b>42 million children between the ages of five and thirteen work long hours <br> each day to assist in the survival of their families if they have one, or just to feed themselves; therefore, <br> they are not able to go to school. Children are being exploited in many other ways including prostitution. <br> A majority are suffering from malnutrition and have no access or very limited access to health care <br> facilities. <br> <b><i>Political and Economic Turmoil</i>: </b>The deteriorating financial situation is creating instability in many of <br> the countries. For example, the banking system in Argentina has collapsed leaving the people without <br> access to their savings, while Uruguay and Brazil are suffering similar problems. Recently, the <br> government of Venezuela was brought down by a coup d&rsquo;etat, but the people managed to reinstate their <br> elected president. However, tension remains high in Venezuela and rumors of conspiracies against the <br> duly elected government are rampant. Haiti is once more suffering political insecurity that does not help <br> in responding to the chronic ills of the poorest country in the western hemisphere. The financial havoc, <br> the failure of political systems to respond to the needs of the people and the growing violence are <br> producing a significant rise in migration. Border issues are becoming more frequent. <br> <b><i>Afro-Latin, Afro-Caribbean, and Indigenous Peoples</i>: </b>According to the World Bank and the Inter- <br> American Development Bank statistics, of the 502 million people who live in Latin America and the <br> Caribbean, 120 million are of African descent and 40 million are indigenous people. These two groups <br> constitute the majority of the poor in the region. They have less access to formal education, health care <br> and other social services, while encountering greater discrimination based on race/color in accessing basic <br> institutions, including the justice system. <br> <b>Implications <br> </b>There is a long list of indicators of the need for attention and assistance. These named above, without <br> mentioning the violence in Colombia and to lesser scale in other countries, are sufficient to show that the <br> Caribbean and Latin American region needs urgent attention. The deteriorating economic and political <br> contexts increase the demand for social assistance from the churches in the Latin America and Caribbean <br> region. Regretfully, most churches are suffering financial crises similar to those that their countries are <br> experiencing. For example, in Argentina, pastors&rsquo; salaries are not paid in full, even if they serve large <br> congregations. This is because the church members are not receiving their salaries, even when they are <br> working; therefore, they have no money to put in the offering plate. Argentina is the Latin American <br> country with the highest human development index (HDI of 0.842 in 1999). The economic crisis in <br> Argentina is causing a progressive decline of governmental social programs due to lack of funds while <br> poverty, hunger, and unemployment rise. The same situation will soon be experienced by many other <br> countries in the region. If churches and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) do not pay attention to <br> the critical situation now, the future appears grim for Latin America and the Caribbean. <br> <b>The Call <br> </b>There is an urgent need for a coordinated strategy within The United Methodist Church in collaboration <br> with CIEMAL, the Methodist Church of the Caribbean and the Americas (MCCA) and other Methodist <br> churches and ecumenical organizations in the Latin America/ Caribbean region. We are encouraged by <br> the invitation of the United Methodist Council of Bishops to the Methodist bishops and church presidents <br> of the autonomous churches in the Caribbean and Latin America who met in Puerto Rico in November <br> 2002. We hope that this will be the beginning of a fruitful dialogue that will address in a significant <br> manner the increased needs of the region. We call upon the program agencies of The United Methodist <br> Church to increase their support of ministries responding to the deteriorating social conditions of the <br> growing number of the population who live in severe poverty. <br> We call upon the General Board of Church and Society (GBCS) to study the relationship between the <br> policies of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the financial turmoil being experienced in different <br> Latin America countries. The church needs the study to be able to advocate intelligently for systemic <br> reforms that affirm life over financial considerations. We call upon GBCS to also advocate in the US <br> Congress to obtain a financial aid package for the Latin American countries in financial crisis without <br> compromising their sovereignty or undermining their responsibility to provide for the needy. Measures of <br> structural adjustment imposed by international creditors increased the suffering of the poor. Countries are <br> not able to pay their external debt and provide services urgently needed by the population. GBCS should <br> continue its advocacy for debt relief, including education of the UMC constituency regarding these issues. <br> We call upon the General Board of Global Ministries (GBGM), the General Board of Discipleship and the <br> General Board of Higher Education and Ministries to seek ways to undergird effectively the ministries of <br> the emerging Methodist churches in Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The <br> relatively new churches are in great need of opportunities for leadership development. We ask these <br> agencies in collaboration with General Council on Ministries and the Council of Bishops to call for an <br> event where representatives of the annual conferences doing work in different parts of the Caribbean and <br> Latin America and other interested persons could share experiences and strategies to increase our level of <br> support and enable local churches in the US to grow by being directly involved in mission. <br> We call upon United Methodist Communications (UMCom) to provide more coverage to the news <br> coming out of church sources in the Caribbean and Latin America. Also, United Methodist <br> Communications is asked to help in the mission education of United Methodists by informing them of the <br> mission realities in Latin America and the Caribbean. <br> We affirm the Native American International Caucus (NAIC) for establishing linkages with Methodist <br> indigenous communities in Latin America. We encourage them to continue to do so. We encourage <br> Black Methodists for Church Renewal (BMCR) to also establish linkages in Latin America and the <br> Caribbean. <br> We call upon all annual conferences and every United Methodist to pray for and support the development <br> of church programs in the Latin America/ Caribbean region. We are grateful for all the persons who have <br> sent their contributions to the permanent fund Encounter with Christ in Latin America and the Caribbean <br> (GBGM Fund 025100), contributed to the Advance, or participated in VIM teams or other mission teams <br> to be in ministry in the Latin American/Carribean region. All these forms of collaboration need to be <br> increased and new ones established in response to the needs of the region. <br> MARCHA proposes the 2004 UMC General Conference address the needs of the poor around the world <br> and build bridges among the poor in different regions of the world. Jesus is among the poor inviting us to <br> respond in Christian love to their needs. <br> <i><br> <b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
