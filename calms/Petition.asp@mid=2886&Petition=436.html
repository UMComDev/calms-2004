<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >Amend resolution 249 as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><CENTER><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >249.&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigrants and Refugees: To Love the Sojourner<br> <b> </b><i>I. Biblical/Theological Basis <br> </font></CENTER></i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >The Bible is full of stories of sojourners, strangers without homes, whom God called people to protect. The Israelites<strike> -God&rsquo;s chosen people-</strike> were themselves sojourners for forty years ... <br> </font><CENTER><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >II. Global Uprootedness <br> </font></i></i></CENTER></i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >We live in a world ....They are given different labels depending on their circumstances: <i>... internally displaced<b> persons (IDPs) </b></i>-people who are displaced within the borders of their own lands because of civil strife but who cannot receive the protection of the international community because of the principle of national sovereignty; <i>economic migrants</i>-those who flee dire poverty in search of employment and a way to feed their families. No matter what label they are given, they are usually vulnerable people in need of compassion and protection. Most of them are women and children; often, the women are subjected to the brutality of sexual violence. <br> <strike> Even when refugees are allowed to return home, they face many problems, such as the possibility of being killed or maimed by land mines which have been left behind by former combatants. <br> Millions of land mines strewn wantonly during the wars in Cambodia, Mozambique, El Salvador, Bosnia, Angola, Liberia, and Sierra Leone continue to kill and maim innocent victims as they struggle to rebuild their lives. <br> It is clear that the uprooted are vulnerable and need the protection of the international community. Their numbers are growing as more people worldwide become victims of wars, economic injustice, and environmental degradation. The 1990s have been termed the &ldquo;decade of uprootedness,&rdquo; and the 2000s do not show promise of getting any better. <br> Most refugees come from the South and remain in the South, in countries where they have sought asylum and where conditions are barely humane. It is a myth that all people on the move wish to come to the nations of the North, but those who do come because it is their last hope for life. They have no choice. The nations of the industrialized North that are better equipped to provide safe haven to uprooted persons are currently lacking in the moral and political will to do so. Instead, the governments of these nations are reacting to a worldwide rise in xenophobia and racism by sharply curtailing existing programs that benefit newcomers and by instituting restrictive legislation designed to satisfy the nativists in their constituencies. Uprootedness is seen by the governments of the industrialized North as a problem to be dealt with by force rather than as a complex phenomenon needing coherent and humane solutions on a global scale. Uprooted people are looked upon as the cause of societal problems and are being blamed for increasing economic difficulties. Consequently, even refugees fleeing persecution are denied their human rights and the protection they need to save their lives, and they are summarily excluded and ostracized by governments. In Europe, many governments are implementing policies that are designed to prevent asylum seekers from successfully finding refuge within their borders. The recent increase in the number of uprooted persons demonstrates that the international community, including the churches, must focus more attention on understanding and alleviating the causes of forced human uprootedness, as well as responding to the consequences.</strike> <br> </font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >Even when refugees feel they can return home safely, they face immense problems in restarting their lives, including possible injury or death from the landmines strewn wantonly during the period of conflict. Refugees now returning to Sri Lanka, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, and Angola, who are facing these horrors and landmines<i> </i>that still remain in parts of Mozambique, Cambodia and Bosnia, even after years of de-mining efforts. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uprooted people need the protection of the international community in the years before it is safe to return home. A potent mix of unstable governments, political and economic injustice, and ethnic and religious strife combine to produce sudden violence, terror, and refugee flight. More people are displaced every day. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nations of the Global South are particularly prone to conditions which produce refugees. Most refugees and IDPs, once temporarily accommodated in stark situations in camps or urban centers, wait an average of ten years before conditions in their homeland stabilize and permit a safe return. For refugees whose lives are in imminent danger, their last hope is to seek asylum in the countries of North America, Western Europe, and Australia. Yet these wealthy nations lack the political and moral will to provide safe havens in the face<i> </i>of nativist demands. Uprootedness is seen by the governments of the industrialized nations as a problem to be dealt with by force rather than a complex phenomenon needing coherent and human solutions on a global scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of September 11, 2001 (9/11), uprooted people are not only looked upon as the cause of societal problems, but as threats to national security. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result of the terrorist attacks for asylum seekers arriving in the United States was to set back hopes for reform of the asylum process. Since 1997, most asylum seekers are detained until their case is adjudicated and they are either granted asylum or deported. They are denied due process and held in conditions as bad or worse than those of convicted felons--conditions which heap further suffering on those who have fled persecution and even torture. Additionally, the response to 9/11 was not only a setback for asylum seekers in the United States but seriously impacted the U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program for which refugees are interviewed and approved overseas. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the four years prior to 9/11, the United States accepted an average 70,000 refugees for resettlement each year. Refugees approved for the U.S. program had always been the most thoroughly scrutinized of any persons coming into the United States. No refugee had been involved in the events of 9/11, and the lengthy scrutiny involved in entering the U.S. as a refugee would deter any terrorist from attempting that route. Yet it was the Refugee Program--designed to provide refuge to persons who had themselves been victims of terror--that the government targeted with some of its first anti-terrorism measures. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consequences of these actions were to halt refugee flights through December 2001, stop all refugee interviews for four months, require all refugees to be fingerprinted, impose a maximum number of 35 refugees to a flight, and limit them to four ports of entry (now eight). A new security rule requiring an FBI check for all males from Africa and the Middle East between the ages of 15 and 45 can hold up an entire family for eight months until the member in that category is cleared. By adding to this the simultaneous introduction of an improved procedure for verifying the relationship of refugees joining family already in the U.S., the government developed a protracted process resulting in only 28,000 of the 70,000 possible refugee visa slots being filled in Fiscal Year 2002 and a loss of 40,000 refugee places; these slots do not carry over into the next year. (At this writing, FY 2003 looks even more disheartening with only 4,000 arrivals in the first quarter.) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commitment of the U.S. to the resettlement of refugees speaks to its concern for the plight of victims of persecution and terror and serves as an example for other nations. Refugees should be the last people to be the target of anti-terrorism policies--yet, since 9/11, at least 50,000 refugees have lost a chance to restart their lives in the U.S. A restored generous refugee admissions policy would not jeopardize national security and would add to the benefit of the nation and its relationships with nations across the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reduction in refugee admissions is further cause for the international community, including the churches, to effectively address the causes of uprootedness and endeavor to restore the commitment to the protection of refugees. <br> </font></b></b></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" ><br> </font><CENTER><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >III. Immigration and Asylum in the United States <br> </font></i></i></CENTER></i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >Nearly all the citizens of the United States ... and the Immigration, Reform, and Control Act of 1986. <br> <strike> While the United States has a long history of immigration, its experience as a country of first asylum is relatively new and appears minor in comparison to that of many other countries of the world. Countries in Africa have opened their borders to millions of asylum seekers, while the United States has only had to work with asylum applications numbering in the hundreds of thousands.</strike> <br> The 1980s and early 1990s ... asylum they so desperately needed. Recent laws have <strike> provided protection for some of these people, but there are still many more left uprooted and unprotected</strike>&nbsp; <b>enabled many of these people to adjust to permanent residency, although many others are still undocumented</b>. <br> <strike> In the United States, the federal government has passed legislation to prevent further influxes of migrants and asylum seekers by reinforcing the borders and instituting restrictive measures. The United States has engaged in detention practices and forced repatriation of asylum seekers without benefit of fair and equal protection under the law. <br> In 1996, Congress passed three laws which reshaped immigration in the United States: the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRAIRA), the Welfare Reform Act, and the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). This legislation does everything from barring legal immigrants&rsquo; access to government assistance, barring asylum seekers from the rights of due process, allowing secret evidence to be used in deportation hearings to requiring deportation retroactively for past legal offenses by noncitizens. And even though some gains have been made, Congress continues to introduce legislation that is harmful to our immigrant neighbor. <br> These laws have created suffering in the immigrant community and have helped to foster an environment where immigrant bashing, a particularly virulent form of anti-immigrant bias, seems stronger than ever in this atmosphere of misinformation, mistrust, and fear of economic instability. Unwilling to face the reality of their leaders&rsquo; failure to deal expeditiously and honestly with their nation&rsquo;s adjustment to the new global society, many people in the United States have let themselves be vulnerable to the hysteria that says they are no longer in control of their borders or their destiny.</strike> <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >Since 1996, the United States immigration law and policies have been moving toward greater restriction on immigration and less protection of immigrants&rsquo; and refugees&rsquo; rights. Immigrants are singled out for harsh punishment under immigration law for minor and even very old criminal violations. Their eligibility for the social safety net is limited. Immigrants&rsquo; rights to due process of the law are increasingly being circumscribed by nearly all the branches of government, using tactics ranging from judicial review to detention without bond.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >The USA Patriot Act of 2001 mandates the development of a technological system that will ensure the inter-agency sharing of information and tracking and monitoring of foreign visitors&rsquo; entry and exit. However, it was the then Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) under the current administration that had shaped and developed policies beyond the expressed mandate of Congress. In the wake of 9/11, the INS increased its use of secret evidence in immigration hearings, citing threats to national security and barring the immigrants from proceedings or access to evidence against them. It instituted a "Special Registration" program, requiring male nationals of certain countries--predominantly Muslim--to register by providing fingerprints and all key information such as addresses, bank accounts, and credit cards. This program has resulted in the arrest and prosecution of many undocumented immigrants, even those with pending applications for immigration benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >In another area of policy, the U.S. Attorney General has issued a directive that is resulting in serious abridgement of immigrants&rsquo; rights to due process. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has been ordered to clear its backlog of immigration appeals, and it has attempted to do so by increasing the use of one-judge review, instead of a panel of three, and dispensing with opinions supported with analysis, issuing instead one-sentence boilerplate decisions. Coupled with the drastic limitations on judicial review imposed by the 1996 law, this means that immigrants&rsquo; rights to appeal are severely curtailed. In many of the above instances of legal and policy shifts, the government has cited national security as justification. As history has demonstrated, however, when a measure is adopted which affects a broad base of the population without regard to individual circumstances, and where preservation of national security comes at the cost of human dignity and civil rights, such laws or policies often prove unjustified and unjustifiable in the final analysis. The Japanese internment during WWII and the McCarthy investigations are two prime examples. <br> In a time when our nation and world is desperate for peace, security, and community, people of faith and good will are needed to encourage leadership at home and abroad and, especially, in our churches; and to have the courage to speak up for the newly vulnerable people put at risk in the rush to provide for our own safety. We must remember that God's household is bigger than our own. <br> </font></b><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >Therefore</i>, we call upon The United Methodist Church, in collaboration with other ecumenical and interdenominational organizations, to urge the government of the United States as well as all other governments: <br> (1) to encourage and support ... <br> (2) to alleviate conditions ... <br> (3) to take decisive action ... <br> (4) to withhold all support--<strike> diplomatic</strike> , military<strike> ,</strike>&nbsp;and financial--to governments with a documented recent history of abuses and disregard for human rights, particularly the right of asylum; <br> (5) to provide a fair and generous resettlement policy ... <br> (6) to adopt reasonable standards for consideration as refugees for those seeking asylum and to <b>prevent and/or </b>eliminate within the <strike> Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) </strike>&nbsp; <b>Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Bureau for Customs and Border Control, and the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigrant Services of the Department of Homeland Security</b> all abuses of civil and human rights, including such practices as the violation of due process, denial of bond, detention of noncriminal asylum seekers, and hasty deportation of people who are undocumented or overstayed; <strike> and to eliminate restrictive measures applied to asylum seekers at ports of entry, such as summary exclusion without benefit of adequate counseling; <br> <b></strike> (7) </b> <b>to insure that the rights and dignity of all immigrants and foreign visitors are fully respected in all national security measures developed to combat terrorism, and to end Special Registration requirements;</b><strike> <br> (7)</strike>&nbsp; <b>(8) </b>to monitor all attempted reforms ... <br> <strike> (8)</strike>&nbsp; <b>(9) </b>to review and reject all legislative measures that propose summary exclusion for <i>bona fide</i> asylum seekers, <b>to end the practice of detaining asylum seekers during the asylum process, </b>and to ensure access to counsel and meaningful review of asylum claims by an immigration judge;
