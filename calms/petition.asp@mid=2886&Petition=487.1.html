<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Add a new resolution to The Book of Resolution as follows: <br> <br> <b> <font FACE="Times New Roman">United Methodists are called to be faithful to God and to God&rsquo;s actions in the world. As United Methodists we believe that God is the parent of all--that all people are created in God&rsquo;s image and that it&nbsp;&nbsp;is the right of all people to have a full and abundant life. We believe that the resources of creation are God&rsquo;s gift for all people. We believe that as people of God we need to be open to others and welcome especially the sojourners in our midst.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Our nation prides itself of being open to ethnic diversity.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have not always held to that ideal. While some people have been welcomed, others have remained in the outskirts of our cultural core and fabric. Furthermore, the reality is that with time our borders have been getting narrower and a spirit of hostility toward the sojourners in our midst--refugees and immigrants--has grown to the point of rejection and discrimination. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The tragic events of September 11, 2001, rather than helping our nation to become more open and welcoming to the people who seek relief from economic and political pressures as well as from hunger and war in their countries, have blurred our vision and have created a distorted concept of national identity. Refugees and immigrants from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and very specially the Middle East are being unjustly harassed and persecuted. In the name of the law, refugees and immigrant families are being separated, and many persons are being sent back to their countries disregarding the political, emotional, physical, and spiritual consequences of such action. There is fear and anguish in the sojourners in our midst. There is mistrust and hostility toward the sojourners in our midst. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The United Methodist Church's position has been clear on the issue of immigration including those who while working in our land and making their contribution do not have the needed documents for residence. The 2000 General Conference adopted a resolution which specifically charged The United Methodist Church to declare the &ldquo;Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Resolution Act&rdquo; evil and unjust and to call the United States government to accountability and insist upon changes and possible abolition of the 1996 Immigration law, the continued existence of a unified Immigration and Naturalization Service, rather than a division into administrative and enforcement prosecutorial branches, and the development of an amnesty program for undocumented persons (<i>Book of Resolutions</i>, pp. 300-301). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, the immigrant community from Africa, Asia, and Latin America is currently suffering the effects of discriminatory immigration policies we call The United Methodist Church: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 1) To affirm&nbsp;&nbsp;and remind the church through the Council of Bishops, United Methodist Communications and the General Board of Church and Society, the position of The United Methodist Church regarding the rights of refugees, immigrants, and undocumented persons to seek a better life in our land. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 2) To affirm and remind the President of the United States of America, Congress, and other government officials of The United Methodist Church&rsquo;s position on immigration as described in the Resolution on Immigration adopted by the 2000 General Conference and on this resolution. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 3) To promote and distribute both resolutions&nbsp;&nbsp;through the Council of Bishops, United Methodist Communications, and the General Board of Church and Society. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 4) To call our local churches to seek ways to welcome, assist, and empower the refugee, immigrant, and undocumented persons in their neighborhood, and to denounce the persecution of the sojourner in our midst as prejudicial and racist.</b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
