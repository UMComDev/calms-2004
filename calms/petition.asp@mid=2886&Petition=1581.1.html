<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="3" ><br> <i>Suggested Title: </i>Living Into the Future: A Report of the General Council on Ministries to <br> the 2004 General Conference of The United Methodist Church <br> <i>Sponsoring Agency: </i>GCOM <br> <i>Financial Implications: </i>Yes <br> <br> <b> Report No. 1 <br> </b>Petition Number: <br> <b><i>Living Into The Future <br> </i>A Report of the General Council on Ministries <br> To the 2004 General Conference of The United Methodist Church <br> Background <br> </b>In his book, <i>An Unfinished Church, ...a Brief History of the Union..., </i>the late Bishop Paul <br> Washburn clearly articulates the hopes of the new United Methodist Church. He points <br> out that the Joint Commission on Union acknowledged that it did not accommodate the <br> &ldquo;clamoring in the church for a more drastic revision of the church&rsquo;s boards and <br> agencies,&rdquo; settling instead for matching up parallel agencies of the predecessor <br> denominations and seeking to identify competent leadership. <br> In reporting to the 1972 General Conference, the Structure Study Commission&rsquo;s chair, <br> Dr. Dow Kirkpatrick, observed, &ldquo;what we have heard in these four years from the <br> church at all levels clearly is that the elements in the board and agency structures of The <br> United Methodist Church which offer the least power for mission in the future ...are <br> those elements which cannot be dealt with by amending one board here and another one <br> there.&rdquo; &ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; he goes on, &ldquo;these elements are part of the whole system and they <br> must be dealt with in their wholeness if this system is to be renewed.&rdquo;<br> The United Methodist Church, created in 1968, was born with a felt need to study its <br> general church structures and improve them. The Structure Study Commission was the <br> first effort. <br> In the early 1980&rsquo;s the church commissioned a series of seventeen studies presented in <br> books entitled <i>Into Our Third Century</i>. These studies, initiated by the General Council on <br> Ministries and encouraged by the Council of Bishops, produced an extensive analysis of <br> selected issues of fundamental ministry and organizational concerns to the <br> denomination and produced a study of the environment in which United Methodism in <br> the United States serves. <br> During the 1989-92 quadrennium, the General Council on Ministries became aware of <br> increasing interest in and concern about structures and their effectiveness in enabling <br> The United Methodist Church to fulfill its mission. As a result of the Council&rsquo;s work <br> during the 1989-92 quadrennium, the 1992 General Conference mandated a <br> Connectional Issues Study to &ldquo;lead the church in a time of discernment and study of its <br> mission and structural needs...&rdquo; and recommend back to the next General Conference. <br> The Connectional Issues Study Task Force recommended &ldquo;alternative organizational <br> strategies for maximum missional effectiveness.&rdquo;<br> In receiving the Connectional Issues Study report, the 1996 General Conference renewed <br> the call for analysis and created the Connectional Process Team to lead the church in <br> discerning what structural changes might enhance United Methodist efforts to be <br> faithfully in mission for Christ in service to the world. <br> <b>Mandate <br> </b>Meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 12, 2000, the General Conference of The United <br> Methodist Church voted down the recommendations of the Connectional Process Team <br> and mandated that the General Council on Ministries &ldquo;determine the most effective <br> design for the work of the general agencies and...provide enabling legislation to the <br> 2004 General Conference. <br> This mandate narrowed the focus of the continuous discussion of the last three decades <br> to one specific question-What is the most effective design for the work of the general <br> agencies of The United Methodist Church? The General Council on Ministries has <br> worked diligently to discern an answer to that question and is pleased to present this <br> report entitled <i>Living Into The Future. <br> <b></i>Process <br> </b>The members and staff of the General Council on Ministries have listened intently and <br> carefully to members of the church across the United States and in the central <br> conferences. Consultations have been held with representatives of the general agencies, <br> annual conferences, ethnic groups and caucuses, seminaries, and others affiliated with <br> The United Methodist Church. For three years, the Council has sought prayerfully to <br> discern what is the most effective design for the relationship among these important <br> agents of ministry. <br> In 2001 the Servant Leadership Team (executive committee of the General Council on <br> Ministries) commissioned a writing team with the charge to bring forward the best <br> synthesis of what was gleaned from the listening effort and what was judged to be the <br> best proposal for consideration by the Council. The proposal brought forward failed to <br> gain the members&rsquo; support, although elements of it were endorsed and forwarded to a <br> new writing team which, in 2001, was commissioned by the Council to further study, <br> consult and discern what best would meet the expectations of the General Conference <br> and the needs of the church for coordinated, collaborative ministry carried out by the <br> general agencies. <br> In a series of five meetings, electronic and face-to-face, the General Council on Ministries <br> has arrived at a clear sense that what is presented herein meets those criteria. The <br> values and assumptions which underlay and supported the work of the Council in <br> responding to the mandate of the General Conference are outlined in the narrative <br> portion of the proposal. The proposal represents a bold, first step to create an <br> environment for ongoing discernment in faithfulness to the objective that the church <br> might be more holistic, more collaborative, more efficient and more agile in its work at <br> the general agency level. <br> The General Council on Ministries completed work on the document in September 2003 <br> and prayerfully offers this proposal as a faithful response to its mandate. <br> <b>LIVING INTO THE FUTURE PROPOSAL <br> Historical Grounding <br> </b>From the beginning of the organization of the church at the Christmas Conference of <br> 1784, our church has engaged in collaborative and conciliar decision making. At that <br> conference the members, both pastors and lay preachers, determined together their <br> salaries and outlined the work for the coming year. When plans were made to ordain <br> Francis Asbury at the request of John Wesley, he was willing to accept ordination to <br> Superintendent (Bishop) "only if they elect me." From that day to this "As United <br> Methodists, we respond to the working (of the Holy Spirit) through a connectional <br> polity based upon mutual responsiveness and accountability." <i>(Book of Discipline, 2000</i>, <br> �101.1) From that day to this we have been guided both by elected leaders and <br> conciliar bodies acting on behalf of the whole . <br> <b>General Conference Mandate <br> </b>The General Conference, the central conciliar body of The United Methodist Church, <br> received in the year 2000 the report of the Connectional Process Team, amended the <br> report and adopted a motion that included the following mandate to the General <br> Council on Ministries: <br> <b><i>3. To determine the most effective design for the work of the general agencies <br> and to provide implementing legislation to the 2004 General Conference. <br> </b></i>The GCOM has responded to that mandate and now submits proposed legislation in <br> the materials that follow this preamble. We offer this work to the General Conference as <br> we proceed together to determine the will of God for our general church structures in <br> the immediate future. Although the General Conference directed the GCOM to speak <br> only to the most effective design for the work of the general agencies, it is envisioned <br> that a close relationship with the Council of Bishops is integral to an effective design. <br> In keeping with its constitutional mandate "to initiate and direct all connectional <br> enterprises of the Church...&rdquo; (�15.8 ) the General Conference has, from time to time, <br> altered the relationship among the parts. However, it has consistently perpetuated both <br> the conciliar nature and the connectional structure of the whole. The work of the <br> general agencies is complex, yet there is a remarkable connection among them, a <br> connection to each other, the annual conferences and the local churches. Collaboration, <br> presently strong and growing can be enhanced as we work together seamlessly, <br> honoring our vital functions in service to Jesus Christ. It is essential that the general <br> agencies continue to grow as strategic partners in the shared ministry of the church . <br> <b>Connectional Table <br> </b>We believe that two additional issues need addressing to further strengthen the <br> connection. 1) While respecting the individual responsibilities of each of the general <br> agencies, a forum where all agencies and non-agency members have the opportunity <br> to give voice and vote on matters of common interest is needed. 2) The historic and <br> ongoing commitment of the UMC to financial integrity and independence has <br> inadvertently led to structures that separate ministry and financial decisions. There is a <br> need for a place where continuing discernment, articulation, and implementation of <br> God&rsquo;s vision for the church can be undertaken in response to General Conference <br> legislation, Council of Bishops&rsquo; expressions and the needs of the world. <br> Therefore, we propose the creation of a Connectional Table as the most effective means <br> of addressing these matters. <i>The purpose of such a body would be for the discernment and <br> articulation of a vision for the church and the stewardship of the mission, ministries and <br> resources <b>of </b></i>The <i>United Methodist Church as determined by the actions of General Conference <br> and in consultation with the Council of Bishops. <br> </i>This Connectional Table would need to integrate and synthesize the essential, current <br> work of the General Council on Ministries and the General Council on Finance and <br> Administration, keeping intact the work of all the other general agencies as currently <br> described in the <i>Book of Discipline</i>. It would engage in mutual discernment of God&rsquo;s <br> vision for the church, and maintain accountability for our common task. <br> Keeping in mind that checks and balances, such as auditing functions, are essential to <br> responsible stewardship, such work must be continued. However, entrusting allocation <br> decisions to an elected table representing the interdependent network of members <br> familiar with the work of the agencies would foster sound decision making, reduce <br> duplication of effort and strengthen the connection. <br> Our church flourished and grew when it had strong leadership focused on articulating <br> core values, discerning and articulating a clear vision, and championing a flexible <br> system to deliver mission. A Connectional Table that is motivated by faithfulness to the <br> mission of the church to make disciples of Jesus Christ would work in the following <br> ways: It would be global in scope and holistic in understanding. It would be inclusive <br> in nature and collaborative in style. While being efficient in the stewardship of <br> resources, it would be transparent, accessible, and accountable in relationships. <br> <b>About the Term &ldquo;Council&rdquo;<br> </b>The constitution of The United Methodist Church provides for only two councils: the <br> Council of Bishops and the Judicial Council. We suggest that the designation of <br> "council" be reserved for only the bodies of the general church which have constitutional <br> bases. <br> <b>Underlying Principles/Assumptions/Values <br> </b><font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Book Antiqua">The annual conference is the basic unit of The UMC. <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Book Antiqua">The UMC is uniquely conciliar and connectional. <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Book Antiqua">The units of the church-local congregations, annual conferences, jurisdictional <br> conferences, central conferences and general agencies-are essentially and <br> fundamentally interdependent. <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Book Antiqua">The UMC is called to inclusiveness and seeks to reflect in its structures the diversity <br> of the church membership, denying every semblance of discrimination. <br> <font FACE="Symbol"></ul><li><font FACE="Book Antiqua">The UMC, in Africa, Europe, Asia and the United States, seeks to strengthen its <br> understanding and expression of its global nature.
