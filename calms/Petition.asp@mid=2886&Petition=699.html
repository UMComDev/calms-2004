Nuclear technology presents a special challenge to our call to be stewards of God&rsquo;s creation <b>(Psalm 8:6-8) </b>because of the risks involved in the production, handling, and disposal of long-lived nuclear byproducts (such as plutonium) in the energy and weapons-production cycles. <strike> As long as <b></strike> Until </b>society <b>dis</b>continues <b>the </b><strike> to</strike>&nbsp;use <b>of </b>nuclear power to produce energy and weapons, we have a special responsibility to ensure that God&rsquo;s creation be protected for present and future generations by insisting that the entire production cycle be as safe as possible. <br> The problem of nuclear safety is of worldwide concern. It is the responsibility of the church to use its influence internationally to prevent the devastation that could result from nuclear disasters. <br> </font><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >United Methodist Policy <br> </font></i></i></i><strike><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The United Methodist General Conference affirmed the use of nuclear power for energy production but noted that the &ldquo;nuclear energy option also has many problems to be faced&rdquo; (The Book of Resolutions, 1984; page 160). Among these many problems, it particularly identified the health hazards from &ldquo;ionizing radiation [that] threaten the exposed individual to additional hazards such as cancer and sterility, and also threaten future generations with birth defects and gene mutations&rdquo; (The Book of Resolutions, 1984; page 238). <br> The General Conference urged society to examine the ethical and environmental effects of technological developments and ensure that these technologies be in accord with God&rsquo;s plan of wholeness for all creation. It also &ldquo;oppose[d] the production of nuclear weapons and the resultant production of tremendous amounts of nuclear waste that endangers the environment&rdquo; (The Book of Resolutions, 1984; page 339).<br> <b> </strike> Through its Energy Policy Statement, The United Methodist Church affirmed the need to explore all sustainable energy options while highlighting the environmental risks posed by certain options including nuclear power.&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hazards in storing radioactive wastes for thousands of years and the destructive potential of a catastrophic accident involve a great risk of irreversible damage to the environment or to the human genetic pool."</sub><sup>1</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the Church has reiterated its opposition to "the production and testing of weapons designed to destroy or harm God's creation, such as ... nuclear weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;We urge the abolishment of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and urge the cleanup of sites contaminated by chemical biological and nuclear weapons waste.'</sub><sup>2</sup></sub></b><strike> <br> </font></strike></strike><i></strike><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Background <br> </font></i></i><CENTER><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Nuclear Power <br> </font></CENTER><b></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Although there has been a pause in construction of new nuclear capacity in the United States - no nuclear plants have been ordered since 1978 and none has come on-line since the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar 1 reactor ordered in 1970 and licensed to operate in 1996 - the waste generated by current nuclear operations continues to pile up and policy-makers are debating the merits of encouraging construction of new nuclear reactors.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States there are currently 103 licensed reactors operating at 65 plants in 31 states.&nbsp;&nbsp;Worldwide, nearly 433 reactors generate roughly 17% of global electricity. <br> </b>The accident at Chernobyl on April 28, 1986 <b>- and its legacy of radiation, contamination and cancer--</b><strike> ,</strike>&nbsp;demonstrate<b>s</b> the dangers involved in the production of nuclear energy. This accident was much larger than the one at Three Mile Island <b>in 1979</b>. However, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission&rsquo;s Reactor Safety Study points out that accidents even larger than Chernobyl are possible for U.S. reactors. Despite the difference between the design of the Chernobyl plants and the designs of most U.S. plants, there are, according to the Reactor Safety Study, many accident scenarios possible in U.S. plants that could lead to substantial releases of radiation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>In March 2002, at the Davis-Besse nuclear plant near Toledo, Ohio, authorities discovered that leaking boric acid had corroded a six-inch hole in the reactor vessel head leaving only a quarter-inch-thick stainless steel liner to prevent a potentially catastrophic release of reactor cooling water.&nbsp;&nbsp;This most recent example of safety-related shortcomings at nuclear plants further increases concerns raised after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's oversight is insufficient and additional security and safety measures are needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><strike> Those safety analyses indicate that even after the improvements instituted after the Three Mile Island accident, there is a substantial chance of a core meltdown among the 107 currently licensed U.S. commercial nuclear power plants over the next twenty years. <br> In the past few years, while other nations with a sizable commitment to nuclear power have increased their efforts to improve nuclear power-plant safety, the U.S. efforts have been inadequate. Countries such as Japan, West Germany, and Sweden have demonstrated that there are practical and reasonable options available to improve reactor safety. These nations&rsquo; records show outstanding quality in plant construction, plant materials and equipment, extensive preventive maintenance programs, outstanding levels of human performance, plant reliability, and few unplanned shutdowns, equipment failures, or personnel errors. In the U.S., the nuclear power industry is plagued by human error (operators falling asleep on the job), poor maintenance practices, poor management, poor design, and a serious gap in contractor accountability. In 1985 alone, there were almost 3000 plant mishaps and 764 emergency shutdowns, up 28 percent from 1984.</sub><sup>1</sup></sub><br> </font><CENTER><i></strike><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Department of Energy Reactors <br> </font></i></i></CENTER></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The Department of Energy (DOE) operates <strike> over</strike>&nbsp; <b>more than </b>200 nuclear facilities.... Yet most DOE plants continue to be exempt from the far more rigorous examination of commercial reactors by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <br> </font></sub><sup><font SIZE="1" FACE="Times New Roman" >1</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua Gordon, as cited by Christopher Flavin, Worldwatch Paper 75: &ldquo;Reassessing Nuclear Power: The Fallout from Chernobyl&rdquo;; March 1987. <br> </font></sup><CENTER><i><font SIZE="2" FACE="Times New Roman" >Emergency Planning and State Rights <br> </font></i></i></CENTER></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >After the Three Mile Island accident... as well as increase the dangers of a serious accident. <br> </font><CENTER><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Nuclear Wastes <br> </font></i></i></CENTER></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >One of the most controversial and costly components of the nuclear fission process is the creation of radioactive byproducts. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission divides wastes into two different categories according to the level and duration of radioactivity: high-level and low-level wastes. <b>Each reactor produces an annual average of 20 tons of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel and 50-200 cubic meters of low-level radioactive waste.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Since the 1950s, the Department of Energy has been searching for a viable way to dispose of the wastes created by commercial nuclear reactors (irradiated fuels) and high-level wastes from weapons production. These wastes are highly radioactive and will remain radioactive <strike> for long periods of time <b>thousands of years</b></strike> . Presently, these wastes are stored within nuclear facility sites, creating what one member of Congress called hundreds of &ldquo;de facto nuclear waste dumps.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Over the past six decades, these by-products have been accumulating at storage sites throughout the country, including an estimated 45,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear power plants with another 2,000 tons generated annually.</b><br> The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 <b>(NWPA) </b>set a schedule for the location, construction, and operation of two high-level waste geologic repositories, one in the east, and one in the west. <b>Amendments to NWPA in 1987 restricted the repository site studies to one location:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yucca Mountain.&nbsp;&nbsp;This site is located in Nevada, a state which itself has no nuclear reactors, and on land considered sacred to the Western Shoshone and Pauite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><strike> Unfortunately, the U.S. nuclear-waste policy remains in disarray.</strike>&nbsp; <b>To a large extent, p</b>olitical considerations have taken precedence over safety and scientific considerations, and there has been improper and inadequate consultation and cooperation with state governments and Native American tribes. <b>In 2002, Yucca Mountain was designated as the nuclear fuel repository over the objections of Nevada's elected officials, tribal representatives, and environmental advocates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Proponents of the site highlighted the area's geological stability despite the occurrence of an earthquake registering 4.3 on the Richter scale the month of the Congressional vote. <br> Construction of the Yucca Mountain repository will not be completed for years and shipments of the radioactive waste-raising deep safety concerns for the millions of residents living along shipment routes - will take decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;While billed as creating a "central repository" for waste, spent nuclear fuel must remain for years on-on-site before it is "cool" enough to transport, so this process would merely create a new, larger storage site in addition to the 100-plus on-site storage facilities that would continue to store nuclear waste.</b><strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear examples of the fragmented and problem-ridden condition of the U.S. nuclear-waste policy include an April 1985 proposal to build a Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facility within the state of Tennessee (an interim facility to make up for expected delays in the permanent repository schedule); and a May 1986 DOE recommendation for a permanent waste-storage site in Texas, Nevada, or Washington, and postponement of further siting activities for an eastern site (in order to avoid placing a nuclear waste site in states where the Department of Energy expects strong political opposition). The MRS facility is intended to receive 15,000 metric tons of nuclear waste (20 percent of the capacity of the permanent repository) and package it for delivery to a permanent repository for final disposal. Critics feel that the MRS proposal is being offered by DOE solely as an expedient way of relieving utilities of the burden of on-site, spent fuel storage. Little research has been done as to the increased hazards of such a plan. Building the MRS would increase the likelihood of a transportation accident due to the need to ship waste twice. Moreover, there will likely be political pressure to convert the MRS into a &ldquo;semipermanent&rdquo; repository without careful environmental review. <br> </font><i></strike><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Recommendations <br> </font></i></i></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The United Methodist Church ... <br> </font><CENTER><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >We recommend: <br> </font></i></i></CENTER></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(1) <i>Reviewing the safety of operating plants</i>.<i> </i>Each ... <br> <font SIZE="3"><br> <u>Footnotes <br> </font></u></sub><sup><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >1</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;2000 Book of Resolutions, Resolution #6 - Energy Policy Statement <br> </sub><sup>2</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ibid<b><font SIZE="1">
