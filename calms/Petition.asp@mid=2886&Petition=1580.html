The report included the following recommendation:<font COLOR="#ff0000"><br> </font><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" ><font COLOR="#000000">During 2002, the GCFA and GCOM shall conduct an evaluation of the Churches&rsquo; Center for Theology and Public Policy and based on the evaluation the two Councils shall agree on funding allocations to the Center for 2003 and 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The evaluation will be based on four criteria:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></i></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ability of the Churches&rsquo; Center to increase levels of financial support from other denominations and churches. It is hoped that the amount of contribution from other denominations and churches will increase by at least $10,000 per year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inclusiveness (e.g. ethnicity and gender) in the board membership and persons selected to contribute writing to the Center&rsquo;s publications.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Center efforts to increase efforts of outreach to United Methodist constituencies to inform them of the Center&rsquo;s work and encourage use of its resources and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Center efforts to increase efforts of outreach to other denominations and churches to inform them of the Center&rsquo;s work and encourage use of its resources and services.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >This is the second report of an evaluation team relating to the above instructions. The first report was submitted to the General Council on Finance and Administration and the General Council on Ministries with the following recommendations: <br> </font><i><font COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >The committee recommends that the General Council of Finance and Administration and the General Council on Ministries adopt the following funding levels for the Churches&rsquo; Center for Theology and Public Policy. <br> <br> <b> For 2003</b>, funding in the amount of $50,000, and up to an additional $20,000 for consultative services for the Center pertaining to:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></i></i></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" ><br></font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" ></li></li></li><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Developing the Center&rsquo;s ability to secure strategic long-term funding from other denominational and church or religious sources, and <br> <ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Helping the Center to clarify its understanding of its mission/vision. <br> </font></li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >This funding is given with the understanding that the evaluation committee will have input in the selection of the consultant(s), with right of approval of the process, and full access to information developed in the course of the consultation. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>For 2004</b>, funding in the amount of $40,000, and up to an additional $30,000 in matching funds for other denomination and religious sources secured by the center. The terms and conditions of the matching process shall be developed as part of the 2003 consultative process. <br> </i><br> The two councils adopted these recommendations. <br> </font></i></i><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" ><font COLOR="#000000">January 16 & 17, 2003 Review <br> </font></b></b></b><font COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Committee: <br> Attending from GCFA, Rev. Dr. Donald R. Avery, Rev. Patricia B. Hinker, and Rev. Reuben L. Wilbur and from GCOM, Dr. Carolyn Johnson, Bishop John L. Hopkins and Dr. Robert Hoshibata. Staff attending were Rev. Robert Fishel and Mr. Donald L. Hayashi.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Schedule: 
<ul><li></li></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >The team first met alone to develop issues, questions, and concerns relating to the consultant&rsquo;s report.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">The committee then met with a number of the Center&rsquo;s board of directors and Tom Trotter (consultant), who made a brief report. </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">An evening session with Bruce Birch and Tom Trotter followed with more detailed questions about the proposed merger. </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Friday morning, the committee met with David McAllister-Wilson and June Demlan around further questions and concerns about the proposed Center-Wesley merger. </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Finally the committee met to clearly define how the 2004 matching funds were to be distributed, to consider final questions regarding the consultant&rsquo;s report, and to propose recommendations to the Councils.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </font></li></li></li></li></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >Evaluation: <br> The committee reviewed the Consultant&rsquo;s report with great interest and has no major disagreement with the Consultant&rsquo;s findings. Adequate funding will remain a concern for any program and the funds granted from the Methodist Corporation Trust would have to be matched in a significant manner to have a viable program. Communication links with United Methodists must be strengthened and outreach to other denominations is necessary if the Center is to be an ecumenical enterprise. There is a pressing need for the Center to evaluate its mission in light of the changing circumstances and in light of the major issues facing the nation and church today. However the committee is not sure that the concerns expressed in our last report were adequately addressed. The blanket recommendation of a merger between the Center and Wesley is proposed as the solution, but no other alternatives are suggested or ruled out. One can only assume that the merger of the Center and Wesley would eliminate recurring issues and concerns of the last 25 years. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Recommendations: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the Methodist Corporation Trust shall continue to be under the custody and management of the General Council on Finance and Administration.<br><br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we affirm the vision for the Churches' Center for Theology and Public Policy as first expressed by Bishop Mathews to the 1976 General Conference when he said "It is a center...to do the basic scholarly research of the theological and Christian nature which would inform public policy"; and later interpreted by Dr. Bruce Birch, one of the Board members in his March 31, 1999 letter to the Evaluation Team for the Churches' Center for Theology and Public Policy: &ldquo;(The Center) is to foster interaction between theologians, church leaders, policy makers, issue advocates, and theological students committed to the notion that Christian theology has a contribution to make in the public arenas of local, national and international life.&rdquo; <br><br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the Churches&rsquo; Center for Theology and Public Policy as it is currently constituted not be funded in the 2005-2008 quadrennium.<br><br><font COLOR="#000000">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That during the 2005-2008 quadrennium, a Team or Committee composed of members of the GCFA and GCOM be empowered to design a process of informing agencies and other entities of existence of the Methodist Corporation Trust and the vision for which it was established and inviting interested agencies and/or entities to submit proposals for the implementation of the vision. After completing the process, the Team shall make recommendations to GCFA and GCOM of the recommended agency or entity selected to implement the vision and the amount of funding from the Methodist Corporation Trust. Under no circumstances is the corpus of the said trust to be invaded or used to fund any such recommendation. Funds available for consideration shall be restricted to only the interest. <br> </CENTER><br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That a report of all actions and recommendations taken toward implementation of the vision by GCFA and GCOM be made to the 2008 General Conference with recommendations for the future use of the Methodist Corporation Trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" ><font COLOR="#000000" ><b><i>B.

Identical legislation in <i>The Book of Discipline 2000, </i>Par.807.5 and Par.906.26 reads: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>To act in concert with the General Council on Ministries to establish a procedure for making a quadrennial review, initiating proposals and/or responding to proposals by the general agencies regarding the location of headquarters and staff and reporting the same to the General Conference. <br> </i><br> <b>Procedure</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> A joint committee of three members from each agency was appointed as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> GCFA

Hayashi, Staff<i><br> </font></ul></ul></ul></ul></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The Committee had its first meeting in April 2003. This meeting was held fairly late in the quadrennium in order for the Committee to be familiar with the proposals that GCOM was making in its <i>Living Into the Future </i>report to General Conference. This report obviously affects the Committee report as any reorganization proposal has a great influence on the location of general agencies' headquarters and staffs. This is particularly true if any consolidations or mergers take place. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The resources that the Committee used in its deliberations included <i>Report No. 10; Report on General Agency Headquarters/Staff Location</i>, page 612 of the Advance DCA for the 2000 General Conference<i> </i>and the annual<i> Headquarters Property Report</i> to GCFA which includes a risk management survey.&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions in the annual <i>Headquarters Property Report</i> prepared by GCFA are based on Par. 807.6 in <i>The Book of Discipline 2000</i>: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>To exercise on behalf of the General Conference a property reporting function by receiving reports annually from general agencies of the Church concerning property titles, values, debts, general maintenance, lease or rental costs, space usage, and such other information as the council may deem relevant....</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Findings Based on Resources Examined <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b>The Committee went through the materials furnished by the agencies with the following questions in mind: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul><li></li></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >What is the condition of the headquarters property? <br> <ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Is the current location adequate for the staff of the agency? </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Is the agency satisfied with their location and do they internally have any plans to relocate? </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Is there any overwhelming reason in the Committee's collective mind to recommend relocation of any of the agencies? <br> </font></li></li></li></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >The <i>Headquarters Property Report</i>, which is summarized in another GCFA Report to General Conference in the Advance DCA, indicated that all of the general agencies examined have buildings that are in good condition and many have been renovated in the past 6 to 8 years. No comments surfaced from any agency that their location affected their ability to attract and hold staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the agencies except the GCFA indicated satisfaction with their location and do not currently have any internal plans to relocate. This may change between the time this report is written and General Conference in 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several smaller agencies are in discussion at this time with each other about possible mergers and sharing of facilities in order to facilitate the carrying out of their mission. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> GCFA has had a Nashville office for over 30 years. In the fall of 2002 it became apparent that this office was becoming inadequate for the functions that GCFA wished to house there and this initiated a preliminary study into possible consolidation of GCFA into one location. A preliminary study done by staff indicated that consolidation of the office in Nashville would be more economic than consolidating operations in Evanston. It would also put GCFA near four of the general agencies with which it works very closely. Preliminary work indicates that the breakeven point between the savings in operational costs and the costs of consolidating would occur sometime around the eighth year after the consolidation. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> A preliminary plan was presented to the GCFA in the spring of 2003 and the following resolution was passed: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>The Property Services Committee and its GCFA Location Task Force recommend that the Council consolidate its operations in Nashville by December 31, 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> GCFA staff is instructed to develop plans and budgets for relocating council staff and 0perations to Nashville, to be presented to this Council for its approval at its September 2003 meeting. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </i>Further actions around this consolidation of operations were taken by GCFA in the fall of 2003 meeting: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>The GCFA Executive Committee will not undertake any substantial irrevocable action prior to the end of General Conference 2004. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Staff, in keeping with the cooperative and supportive relationship with the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women (GCSRW), will work with GCSRW in consultation with GCOM in addressing any operational concerns resulting from GCFA&rsquo;s consolidation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </i>The GCFA would not be in a position to actually effect the move until after the General Conference in 2004, and therefore, does not plan to take any actions before that time that would have adverse financial effects on the church if for some reason the planned consolidation cannot be carried out.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Recommendations</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> It is the recommendation of the General Council on Finance and Administration and the General Council on Ministries, based on the findings and study of the Committee, that the location of the headquarters buildings and staff of the general agencies of The United Methodist Church (except for the consolidation of the GCFA headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee) remain at their current location for another quadrennium. This recommendation is hedged by the knowledge that the proposed reorganization being presented to the General Conference by the General Council on Ministries can and probably will affect agency headquarters locations if accepted by the General Conference. It is further recommended that the General Council on Finance and Administration continue the examination of the benefits of consolidation in the next quadrennium unless other actions taken by the General Conference would make this action improper.<br> <b> </b><font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
