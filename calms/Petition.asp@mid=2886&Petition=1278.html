<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif" SIZE="3" >Replace resolution 298 with the following: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <u><b><font SIZE="4">United Methodists Sharing the Vulnerability in the Process of Alteration</u><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT"><br> <font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif"><font SIZE="3">The fall of the Berlin wall (1989) was a symbol of a new political order in Europe. Ever since, <br> Europe has been in a process of alteration which has led to both improvements and new challenges. <br> The United Methodist Church recognizes with gratitude a trend to democratisation and increased <br> freedom in many countries as well as a development towards a larger community of European <br> nations. We affirm that many people, among them numerous Christians, including United <br> Methodists, are now more vigilant in the journey of Europe towards �An Area of Freedom, <br> Security and Justice� (expression from European Community Law). <br> After September 11, 2001, people all over the world are more than ever experiencing a profound <br> sense of vulnerability. As a people of faith we are recognizing that a shared vulnerabililty may <br> become more important for mutual understanding and caring than privileged security of some. This <br> shared vulnerability has helped to see the European Process of Alteration in the context of an <br> encompassing global transformation which in particular includes the continents of Africa, Asia and <br> Latin America. <br> A decade ago we rejoiced as we experienced great political changes in Central and Eastern Europe. <br> Today it is clear that the magnitude and the content of the problems encountered have been <br> underestimated by governments, the media, the general public as well as the churches. Rising <br> unemployment and the falling value of pensions and wages has plunged millions of people into <br> poverty. United Nations Development Reports for Central and Eastern Europe show that in 1989 <br> about 14 million people in the former communist block lived with less than four dollars a day. By <br> the mid-nineties that number had risen to 147 million people. Only a small minority has <br> participated in economic growth and development. In many places health care, schooling and <br> education standards declined dramatically whilst commerce-based criminality grew rapidly. <br> Given this situation, the United Methodist Minorities in Europe together with the other <br> denominations emphasises the need for human development through witness for Jesus Christ and <br> through working towards justice for the poor and vulnerable like women, children, gypsies and <br> other ethnic minorities. United Methodists are together in mission to safeguard the local initiatives <br> and the dignity of clergy and lay missionaries, women and men, faithfully responding to the calling <br> of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour. We therefore affirm that church-planting, evangelism and social <br> initiatives in Eastern Europe, Russia, the Baltics and the Balkans require continued support by the <br> larger Methodist family, spiritually and fiancially. Even if local churches may become financially <br> self-sustaining and strong enough to continue the mission among the vulnerable and the poor on <br> their own it should not be forgotten that the Lord&lsquo;s commandment to mission is addressed to the <br> whole Church. <br> We are thankful for the �Fund Mission in Europe�, a solidarity initiative of the European <br> Methodist Council to collect financial means among Methodist congregations in Western and <br> Northern Europe for newly emerging churches and congregations in the East and in the South. The <br> financial and spiritual support generated by local churches and conferences in the USA during the <br> last ten years was an act of rescuing. <br> <u>The process of European integration - hopes and challenges</u><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT"><br> <font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif">The process of change has been strengthened especially by the European Union which aims to <br> work for peace, stability and welfare. The initiation of an unprecedented enlargement involving 13 <br> new candidate countries is an ambition on a new level and on a new scale. Unfortunately, it has <br> become clear that there is a widening gap between the expectations of tangible results on the one <br> hand and loss of patience resulting from dissatisfaction with the actual process on the other hand. <br> Particular challenges in this context are: <br> </ul><li>Transparency in the negotiating process <br> </ul><li>Free movement of persons / migration <br> </ul><li>Human and social costs of the integration process <br> </ul><li>Protection of the rights of minorities <br> </ul><li>Preservation of indigenous (regional) cultures and identities <br> </ul><li>Future borders of the European Union and the relations to the new neighbours <br> </ul><li>Commitment to common (Christian) values <br> As United Methodists, we affirm that the European integration process is a sign of hope. We <br> support efforts for the creation and development of independent regional cooperation and <br> communities of nations, such as the European Union and the OSCE including USA and Canada. At <br> the same time, we are also aware of the dangers that continue to threaten the process toward a new <br> Europe such as self-serving nationalism, serious economic problems and social upheavel. Against <br> this background, the current priorities of the United Methodist Church's human rights program are <br> as follows: <br> </ul><li>Protection of refugees, migrants, asylum seekers and displaced people <br> </ul><li>Social policy questions in the transformation that nations make into market economics <br> </ul><li>Social rights for all, in particular respect and justice for women, children and minorities <br> </ul><li>Religious freedom <br> </ul><li>Environmental and energy policies for a sustainable way of life <br> The Churches are not left untouched by the processes of political, economic and cultural <br> integration. The Conference of European Churches, together with the Roman Catholic Council of <br> European Bishops Conferences, the Leuenberg Church Fellowship and the European Methodist <br> Council, are very actively involved in internal and external processes of integration. In particular, <br> the European Churches developed a �Charta Oecumenica� which is meant to be a helpful tool for <br> dialogue and advocacy for the practical life together of the Orthodox, Protestant, Anglican and <br> Roman Catholic Churches. <br> We believe and affirm that the Churches in Europe have a message of hope. The new Europe can <br> not be built without them. The United Methodist Church is not nationally bound and is, therefore, <br> particularly called upon to advance the goal of integration in the present European process of <br> alteration on the way to a true Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT"><br> Zurich and Budapest, March 5, 2003<font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT"><font SIZE="2"><br> <u><b><font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif"><font SIZE="4">
