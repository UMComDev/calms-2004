<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >Whereas since the birth of mankind, war and threats of war between nations, religions and ethnic backgrounds have kept the world from knowing a true and lasting peace, and <br> Whereas unfathomable pain, suffering and grief have come about from the battles man has waged throughout history continuing today with mankind having devoted more wealth to weapons of war than any other cause, resulting in parallel pain and suffering from hunger, disease, loss of habitat and other sins against humanity as well as our environment and wildlife that have no say in our world, and <br> Whereas today mankind is fed by the hatreds, ignorance and violence that only serve to perpetrate further senseless violence in which we avow vengeance over acts of war that were themselves committed out of&nbsp;&nbsp;revenge or from&nbsp;&nbsp;the fears of those who do not see us as we are or because we do not live as they have lived, and <br> Whereas the hatreds leading to and brought about by war are only feeding further hate for hates sake and serve no purpose to the common good of us <u>all,</u> that neither we or any other child born into this world is born with that hatred but learns of it from the generations before him, and that we have an obligation to the generations awaiting the dawn of their time on earth to stop the senseless wars that divide us and take away their hope, and <br> Whereas the fellowship ministry A Circle Of Friends, working through this conference and with other churches around the globe, has set forth August 22, 2004 for Just 1 Day, 24 hours, of peace requesting that every nation&nbsp;&nbsp;lay down&nbsp;&nbsp;their swords for a period of reflection on ourselves, our enemies and the hatreds that divide us, the terrible loss of life from those hatreds and the further loss of life and suffering to come if we do not choose this time to consider alternatives to the bloodshed of armed conflict, and <br> Whereas no deity of any faith today directs his children to take up arms against another, and knowing that we as&nbsp;&nbsp;one race are capable of remarkable achievements together, we call for only a time of world peace for mankind to consider extending a hand to his foe instead of taking up a sword against him, that we are obligated to consider these acts of conciliation to those we have previously made war against, or who have made war against us, for the sake of both are children and their children of tomorrow. <br> Therefore may it be resolved by this conference that the United Methodist Church supports the initiative brought forth by the ministry of peace at Peoples United Methodist Church and all of its fellowship churches in A Circle Of Friends called Just 1 Day and in doing so: <br></font><font FACE="Wingdings" SIZE="3" >�&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial">will pass along word of this resolution through the UMC networks and media <br></font><font FACE="Wingdings" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial">request that all UM churches support the spirit of Just 1 Day through prayer and active participation, as they see fit,&nbsp;&nbsp;through discussion within each church <br> <font FACE="Wingdings">�&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial">call upon the leaders of the United States of America and the world to commit to this step toward a permanent world peace while passing forth this resolution to the World Methodist Conference for its consideration <br> <font FACE="Wingdings">�&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial">welcome all faiths and denominations of the world to set forth a common doctrine together with us of peaceful coexistence, understanding and acceptance of each others beliefs beginning on August 22, 2004 <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May it also be resolved that with this vote of support today, the United Methodist Church takes this initiative as a show of hope for those who live in a world without hope today, those clouded by the terrible fears of death from war and for the generations of tomorrow that we will pass our world onto, that the monuments and statues of tomorrow will not be built to honor those who made war but those who reached out a hand to another - and made peace. <br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
