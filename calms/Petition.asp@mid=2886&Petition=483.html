<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Add a new resolution to The Book of Resolution as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">&ldquo;The World is my parish&rdquo; said John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. These words have been the motto of United Methodists throughout many generations. Today, when we seem to be living in the midst of an explosion of diversity, once again these words come alive and become more relevant. Even when racial/ethnic/cultural diversity has been a reality in the United States from its very beginnings, this diversity has reached a momentum in our common history both in&nbsp;&nbsp;church and society. Mobility, advanced technology, war, political instability, and socio/economic realities have brought the diversity of the world into our very own neighborhoods and churches, creating a challenge to old principles of church growth such as the homogenous theory. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In response to this reality, many churches have begun by developing multicultural ministries. However, the concern has been raised that the current trend for multicultural ministries has been placed in opposition to the continued development and strengthening of the racial/ethnic local church. Frequently the choice of a multicultural ministry has been done at the expense of what has been called ethnic specific ministries, e.g. Asian, Black,&nbsp;&nbsp;Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and Native American&nbsp;&nbsp;ministries. In other instances, multicultural ministries are being used to dismiss the uniqueness of the different groups; and/or simply as a superficial face make-up (a few different faces in the congregation) that does not impact the life, leadership style, and decision-making of the congregation. In these cases, multiculturalism can be a disguised form of racism. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, the General Commission on Religion and Race is mandated by the Church to ensure the equal participation of all believers as members of the same body that is the body of Christ; and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, the question of multicultural congregations or ethnic specific congregations is not an either/or proposition for inclusiveness but rather two distinct paths needed to achieve the inclusive spirit revealed to us at Pentecost, when people understood each other, not through a common language, but through the power of the Spirit who affirmed and embraced everyone (each one spoke in his/her own tongue), making of many, One; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, a truly multicultural congregation is more than &ldquo;token&rdquo; participation of racial/ethnic persons, but is one that incorporates into the worship style, leadership, and entire ministry cultural elements of the different racial/ethnic groups present in the congregation thus ensuring that everyone has a place at the table where power is shared (resources and decision-making) and where conflict is managed collaboratively, and where everyone brings gifts to the mutually &ldquo;owned table,&rdquo; and where the entire congregation is shaped by all and not by one dominant group; and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, ethnic specific ministries have historically been a source of strength, encouragement, and empowerment for people of color, and have enabled people to move outside of their local congregations to participate in the larger church and have contributed greatly to the inclusiveness of the church; and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, it is important that the church is sensitive to the context of all people and reaches people where they are, including culture and language; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, one of the principles of inclusiveness is self-determination, and people of color in their continued quest for empowerment in the midst of a racist church and society should have the power to determine if their cultural and spiritual needs are best met in an ethnic specific congregation or in a multicultural one; and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, on many occasions an &ldquo;ethnic specific&rdquo; congregation can be the beginning of becoming a multicultural church; and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, multicultural ministries should be look upon as one of the models of the inclusive and multicultural church, and that there are many ways in which the church can be multicultural and inclusive without being together in the same worship service always, such as community work, mission, children and youth, church governance, etc. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b><i>Be it Resolved that:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b></i>The United Methodist Church&rsquo;s commitment to inclusiveness affirms the continued development and strengthening of the racial/ethnic congregations as well as the development and strengthening of congregations which respect, understand, and embrace diversity becoming truly multicultural congregations as defined above. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The Council of Bishops give direction to their annual conferences on this issue so that local churches are provided with resources and guidance in their efforts to respond to their diverse communities. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The General Board of Global Ministries and the General Board of Discipleship continue providing leadership and resources in the development of racial/ethnic congregations and multicultural congregations where everyone has a place at the table and power is shared. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The General Commission on Religion and Race continues collaborating with the General Board of Global Ministries, the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry, the General Board of Church and Society, and the General Board of Discipleship in the development of resources which undergird the creation and the strengthening of multicultural and ethnic specific ministries. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The United Methodist seminaries incorporate into their curriculums the subjects needed to prepare students who will be able to minister in different and diverse settings. <br> </font></b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
