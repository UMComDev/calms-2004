 <tr class="FAC-bodyoftable"><td colspan=2 bgcolor=#DDDaC8><b>Submitted Petition Text:</b><hr>
<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Replace the Report of the Bioethics Task Force with the following statement as follows: <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" ><br> <b>1. All life has some value and deserves our regard as God's creation. The moment at which human protoplasm possesses a soul is a mystery of faith, without answers from the Bible. Thoughtful people of God have arrived at different moral conclusions about treatment of the body at the very earliest and very latest stages of life. Today this includes, for example, different opinions about the moral status of: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#61623;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >a human blastocyst--a microscopic pre-implantation ball of cells lacking organized tissue systems <br> &#61623;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the fetus of a pregnant woman seeking an abortion <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#61623;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An irreversibly comatose patient maintained on medical life-support. <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In these very early and very late stages of life, concern for people with serious diseases and injuries can merge with respect for very early and very late stages of human life via informed, consensual, ethical donation of gametes, blastocysts, and tissues for therapeutic uses and research toward that goal. This is consistent with numerous Biblical examples of Christ's dedication to healing. <br> 3. Fundamental to human life is the privilege and freedom to have children and raise them with love. The Bible gives numerous examples of the blessings of begetting children of one's own, as well as loving and taking responsibility for those who are not our own flesh and blood. Each individual, in consultation with his or her partner, loved ones, doctor, pastor, and other knowledgeable advisors, should determine the best way to achieve reproductive and family-building goals, given their health, values, calling, relationships, and environment.<br> 4. The United Methodist Church does not advocate specific family-building or medical practices or personal choices in the use of resources to have a family. It advocates prayerful decision-making, discussion, greater availability of information, transparency in personal and corporate motives and values, and access to the full range of reproductive and family-building options for all loving parents who are willing and able to raise children to know God's love.<br> 5. Paramount in any difficult reproductive decisions should be respect for the mental and physical health and human dignity of the parents, the children, and the family's life as a whole. <br> 6. Research on human embryonic stem cells has unique potential to generate cures for medical problems currently beyond the reach of existing research materials. This research should be encouraged and kept open to public scrutiny through expert scientific and ethical review and, in countries where it is possible, through financial support from public, academic, and government institutions. <br> 7. Privatization of research and the conduct of research in closed societies have the potential to decrease ethical debate about the technology and increase the likelihood that cures generated by the research will be inaccessible. It also can make the research less subject to scientific review and oversight that promotes quality, safety, and ethical mandates--such as requiring that treatments developed through the research be immunologically suitable for all races of people.<br> 8. Fifty years of research on adult stem cells have not yet shown them to yield productive, therapeutically useful cultures of multipotent stem cells. But this research does show increasing promise, especially for transplantation and in-vivo stimulation of adult stem cells. Research on these stem cells and cells from umbilical cord blood and donated fetal tissue should be encouraged though vigorous public funding. When, and if, new techniques or knowledge from embryo stem cells make it possible to use adult cells instead of embryonic stem cells in tissue therapy, the adult cells should be used. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >9. As advised by the U.S. National Academies of Science and the Institute of Medicine in 2002, reproductive cloning of human beings is medically unsafe and ethically unsound at this time. Reproductive cloning by private or public parties should be strictly prohibited, with immediate, permanent revocation of licensure in addition to severe legal penalties for anyone who implants a cloned embryo into a woman's womb, creates a cloned embryo for that purpose, or provides money or other resources to that end. These laws should be strictly enforced though the examination and licensure of facilities and&nbsp;&nbsp;practitioners working with human oocytes, fetal tissue, and embryonic stem cells. The United Methodist Church should lobby countries and the United Nations to enact laws to this end, with sufficient penalties and resources to deter any human reproductive cloning. <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The transfer of cell nuclei from adults or children into enucleated eggs (donated freely through informed consent) to generate stem cells for therapeutic tissues (or for research toward that end) does not constitute production of a new human being. This process physiologically rejuvenates the nucleus to a stem-cell-like state. At this time scientists do not know what factors within the egg are responsible for this process. It is reasonable to guess that someday they will. The critical ethical prohibition thus should not be on specific in-vitro manipulations of nuclei or gametes, but on the attempt to re-create a person by implanting a cell bearing their genome into a woman's womb.</b><br> </font><font SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman" ><br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><font COLOR="#000000"><br> </font><font COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> <font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
