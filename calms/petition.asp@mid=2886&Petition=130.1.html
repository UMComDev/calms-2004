(<i>1996 Book of Resolutions, </i>p. 130) <br> &ldquo;Sexualized behavior&rdquo; is behavior that communicates sexual interest and/or content.&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples include, but are not limited to displaying sexually suggestive visual materials; making sexual comments or innuendo about one&rsquo;s own or another person&rsquo;s body; touching another person&rsquo;s body; hair; or clothing; touching or rubbing oneself in the presence of another person; kissing; and sexual intercourse. <br> &ldquo;Sexual harassment and sexual abuse within the ministerial relationship&rdquo; represent an exploitation of power and not just &ldquo;inappropriate sexual or gender-directed <br> conduct.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexual harassment is a continuum of behaviors that intimidate, demean, humiliate, or coerce.&nbsp;&nbsp;These behaviors range from the subtle forms that can accumulate into a hostile working, learning, or worshipping environment to the most severe forms of stalking, assault, or rape.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to see both sexual harassment and sexual abuse within</b> <b>relationships at work, school, or church as part of this continuum of brokenness. (<i>1996 Book of Resolutions,</i> p. 130) <br> <center><i>Those in Ministerial Roles <br> </center></font></CENTER></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&nbsp;Both laity and clergy fill ministerial roles in our church programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to clergy or professional staff, any United Methodist may fill a ministerial role by participating in such ministries as: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="3" ></li></li><b><font FACE="Times New Roman">leading and participating in lay speaking ministries;
