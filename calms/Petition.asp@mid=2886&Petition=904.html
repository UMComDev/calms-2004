<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" ><font COLOR="#000000">Add new resolution as follows:<b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> God's vision of abundant living is a world where we live out of a theology of "enough," a theology based in the knowledge that we are grounded in Christ, that our sense of personal value and esteem grows from our Christ-centered life. (<i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Book of Resolutions </i><font FACE="Times New Roman">#188) <br> Then someone came to him and said, &ldquo;Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said, &ldquo;Why do you ask me about what is good?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Jesus outlined the commandments, and the rich young man said, &ldquo;I have kept all of these.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jesus said, &ldquo;If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come follow me.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the young man heard this word, he went away grieving, for he had many possessions (Matthew 18: 16-22; see also Luke 4:18-19). <br> Still the prophets warn us that an economic system based on greed, economic exploitation and indifference to the needs of the poor is contrary to God's will and leads to ruin of the society.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Hear this, you that trample on the needy, and bring to ruin the poor of the land, saying, When will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain; and the Sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale?&nbsp;&nbsp;We will make the ephah small and the shekel great, and practice deceit with false balances, buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and selling the sweepings of the wheat. The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob: Surely I will never forget any of their deeds (Amos 8:4-7; see also Jeremiah 22:13-17). <br> Throughout the Scriptures the people have elected to break covenant with our God who provided abundance for all and instead worshiped idols of greed, materialism, privilege and oppressive power. Likewise our current age worships economic privileges that benefit the rich and powerful. <br> We support measures that would reduce the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few. We further support efforts to revise tax structures and to eliminate governmental support programs that now benefit the wealthy at the expense of other persons. (<i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Book of Resolutions</i><font FACE="Times New Roman">: #163 IV; see also Resolution #197 Economic Justice for a New Millennium) <br> CHALLENGE to GREED <br> It is human greed and hard-heartedness not a scarcity of resources that cause most of the human suffering and material desperation in this world. <br> Greed is seen in both personal practices and in economic and political systems. Greed manifests itself in inhumane practices toward our neighbors. Essential human needs are not treated as human rights, but as assets to be accumulated and sold for profit. For those who cannot pay, greed often demands suffering, groveling obeisance, crushing debt, imprisonment or death. <br> Gandhi predicted: "There is enough in the world for everyone's need; there is not enough for everyone&rsquo;s greed." <br> CALL TO ACTION: <br> <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Be it resolved that </i><font FACE="Times New Roman">the people called United Methodists will search the scriptures concerning greed and pray for forgiveness. In this spirit, we urge:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> That United Methodists look at new international networks such as the World Social Forum to find new ways to challenge greed, share resources, seek new forms of democracy, and defend the resources belonging to all of God's creatures. <br> That the General Board of Global Ministries study and support measures in Congress that would reject new trade agreements that allow continuing subsidies to the richest nations and multinational corporations of the world and restrict the possibilities of advancement of the poorest nations and individuals including family farmers everywhere. <br> That The United Methodist Church oppose tax reduction measures that would increase the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few and reduce the resources available for alleviation of poverty. Progressive taxes such as the Estate Tax and taxes on stock market dividends in the United States should be supported.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> That The United Methodist Church support revision of the tax structures to reduce the regressive taxes paid by the poor worldwide and redouble our efforts toward debt cancellation for the poorest nations. <br> That the General Board of Global Ministries study the Tobin Tax Campaign supported by the World Council of Churches proposing a .3 percent international transfer tax on the $1.3 trillion daily gambling on currency. This currency speculation destroys the ability of countries to protect their currency from devastating ruin. It is proposed that this small tax be used solely in the effort to end poverty, hunger, disease, and illiteracy worldwide. <br> That the General Board of Global Ministries study advertising practices including the laws allowing tax exemption for advertising and recommend actions to the next General Conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> That local congregations organize &ldquo;simple-living&rdquo; seminars in our churches and UMW units. <br> In these and other ways, United Methodists are resolved to study and seek ways of turning from greed to abundance for all.</b><font COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#000000" >
