<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Times New Roman" >
<b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><font SIZE="2">Preamble <br>  The following statement addresses the ethical implications of using human embryos as a source of stem cells for research. It also examines in-vitro fertilization procedures, as they are the source of most of the embryos that are presently used for research. This statement does not explore in detail other kinds of stem cell research, but finds no moral objections to research involving stem cells derived from adult cells or umbilical cord blood. The United Methodist Church has made a commitment to consider all issues in light of concerns for the welfare of all people and the just distribution of resources. In light of that, we wish to state at the outset our conviction that Christians are called to use their resources to meet the basic health care needs of all people. The pursuit of specialized reproductive and research technologies must also be judged in this light.&nbsp;&nbsp;We reaffirm our theological grounding on these issues as found in Section II of the <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">2000 Book of Resolutions</i><font FACE="Times New Roman">, Resolution 90 - &ldquo;New Developments in Genetic Science.&rdquo;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Infertility and Its Remedies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The inability to bear one's own biological children is a sorrow to which Scripture attests. Although Christians believe that the child on whom our hope depends has already been born, Christian couples, like other couples, feel acutely the pain of infertility. However, some of the reproductive technologies seeking to circumvent infertility obscure the Christian recognition of all children as the gifts of God. First, such technologies tempt us to view children as products to be obtained. By the same token, they threaten to overwhelm the embodied and relational aspects of procreation with the realties of the laboratory and the demands of efficient production. Furthermore, the pursuit of &ldquo;children of our own&rdquo; tempts us to limit the scope of our concern to our biological offspring and ignore the pressing needs of other children at home and around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Description of <i>In vitro fertilization</i><br> <i>In vitro fertilization</i> (IVF) is a clinical practice in which a woman&rsquo;s ovaries are hyper-stimulated to release several eggs, which are extracted and subsequently fertilized in a laboratory dish. This is for the purpose of creating embryos to be introduced into the uterus in the hope of implantation, gestation, and eventual birth. Current practice usually involves the extraction of up to 15-16 eggs for fertilization. The resulting embryos that are judged most viable are either introduced into the womb in the initial attempt or frozen and stored for possible later use. Some of the embryos are judged to be less viable than others and are discarded. (Those stored embryos that are not later used become the &ldquo;excess embryos&rdquo; whose use as a source of embryonic stem cells is currently under discussion.) On average, it requires three cycles of IVF to achieve one pregnancy, at an average cost of about U.S. $10,000 for each cycle in 2002. <br> Moral Concerns Prompted by New Reproductive Technologies&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Concerns for Stewardship <br> Even given the painful disappointment of infertility, we believe that expenditure on reproductive technology may not be responsible stewardship. Tempted by the prospect of hopes restored, infertile couples quite often spend disproportionate time, energy, and money on such treatments. In view of the Christian commitment to the love and care of all of our neighbors and to the responsible use of resources of time, money, and care we commend the prayerful consideration of adoption, foster care, and other avenues of parenting for couples faced with infertility. <br> Concerns for the Well-Being of Would-be Parents <br> Reproductive technology may increase, rather than lift, the burdens of infertile couples. As often practiced, reproductive technology may burden couples with alienation from their own bodies and from one another. An infertile woman may find that her body is considered a "problem" to be "fixed." Indeed, reproductive technology unduly burdens women, given that even therapies to compensate for a husband's infertility may involve invasive procedures for the prospective mother. The pursuit of pregnancy places the couple under physical, emotional, and financial strain, depleting the very resources needed for parenting. In addition, many couples face severe disappointment and even depression when, despite all their efforts and expense, their attempts to conceive through IVF are unsuccessful.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Concerns Regarding the Status of Human Embryos <br> A human embryo, even at its earliest stages, is a form of human life. It does not yet possess all the attributes of the human being into which it may develop. However, it already stands in relation to existing human beings, carries all the genetic instructions for the formation of a unique human being, and has a natural trajectory toward that development. Therefore, a human embryo commands our reverence and makes a serious moral claim on us, although not a claim identical to that of a more developed human life. For this reason we should not create embryos with the intention of destroying them, as in the creation of embryos for research purposes. Neither should we, even for reproductive purposes, produce more embryos than we can expect to introduce into the womb in the hope of implantation. <br> In order to maximize medical efficiency and to minimize stress on the potential mother's body, standard IVF practice involves the deliberate overproduction and cryopreservation (medical freezing) of human embryos. Due to the significant strain on a woman's body during the process of obtaining ova, we cannot in good faith recommend that a couple create only as many embryos as they will introduce during one cycle of treatment. Neither can we morally countenance the current practices of overproduction and cryopreservation. Given that we do not foresee a medically and financially responsible way to avoid the overproduction of human embryos through the process of IVF, we urge couples to forgo this means of pursuing parenthood.<font COLOR="#ff0000">&nbsp; <font COLOR="#000000">If a couple makes, nevertheless, a conscientious decision to use IVF, we recommend the following guidelines to minimize the overproduction of embryos.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <ul><li>We urge clinicians and couples to make the determination of how many eggs to fertilize and implant on a case-by-case basis. </li></li><br><li>Only enough embryos should be produced to achieve one pregnancy at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></li><br><li>We insist that rigorous standards of informed consent regarding the procedures, the physical and emotional risks, and the associated ethical issues be applied to all reproductive technologies. This is especially important regarding the disposition of &ldquo;excess&rdquo; embryos and should be the norm of practice around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Some Judgments Regarding the Use of Existing Embryos for Stem Cell Research <br> </font></li></li></li></ul><font COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >There has been a great deal of scientific interest recently generated by research on human stem cells. These are the cells that give rise to other cells. There are a number of potential sources for stem cells, including adult tissues, fetal remains, umbilical cord blood, and human embryos. The use of adult stem cells and stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood raise few moral questions. The use of human embryos as a source for stem cells has been the subject of intense moral debate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <ul><li></li></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" ></li><li><font COLOR="#000000">In our pursuit of &ldquo;children of our own&rdquo; we have acceded to and remained silent about the overproduction and stockpiling of embryos left over from reproductive technologies, such as <i>in vitro<font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;fertilization </i><font FACE="Times New Roman">(IVF). We have thus failed to show due reverence and regard for embryonic life. However, given the tragic reality that most, if not all, of these embryos will be discarded or destroyed, we believe that it is morally tolerable to use existing embryos for stem cell research purposes. This position is a matter of weighing the danger of further eroding the reverence due to embryonic life against the possible, therapeutic benefits that are hoped for from such research. The same judgment of moral tolerability would apply to the use of embryos left from future reproductive efforts if a decision has been made not to introduce them into the womb. We articulate this position with an attitude of caution, not license. We reiterate our opposition to the creation of embryonic life for the sake of research. (See <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Book of Resolutions, 2000</i><font FACE="Times New Roman">, p. 254)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" >The Issue of &ldquo;Therapeutic Cloning&rdquo;<br> In consideration of the potential therapeutic benefits that might eventually arise from research on embryonic stem cells, particular concerns are raised by a proposed practice called &ldquo;therapeutic cloning.&rdquo; This involves taking a donated human egg, extracting its nucleus, and replacing it with a nucleus taken from another body cell. This newly formed cell would then be electrically stimulated to develop into an embryo. This embryo would be the genetic twin of the person whose body cell was used to obtain the nucleus. The cloned embryo would then be used as a source of stem cells, which would be a genetic match for that donor. This procedure might overcome the problem of immune system rejection of cellular treatments that might be developed for an individual from embryonic stem cells. However, such a procedure violates a norm that until recently was almost universally recognized, that human embryos should not be created purely for the sake of research, or created with the advance intention of destroying them. To do so is to treat the human embryo entirely as an object, a being made and destroyed wholly for the sake of others, and to deny completely the reverence we have claimed is due to all stages of human life. For this reason, we firmly oppose any creation of human embryos for the sake of research, including their deliberate creation via cloning as a source for stem cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Recommendation to General Conference for funding 2005 - 2008 <br> </font><font COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Recommend that a task force be formed to complete the charge of the Genetic Science Task force (New Developments in Genetic Science, 90 2000 BOR) (1) to consider the range of issues that are connected with genetic testing, including, but not limited to, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PIGD), prenatal testing as a precursor to therapeutic abortion, and predictive testing in children and adults for late onset genetic conditions; (2) to develop resources for pastoral and congregational use. (3) To commission an analysis of the interests which have funded lobbying efforts and public relations efforts regarding funding of embryonic stem cell research and other embryonic research.</b><font FACE="Tahoma">
