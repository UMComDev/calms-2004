<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >Add new resolution as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><b><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><font COLOR="#000000">"In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters. ... And God said, "Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky.... So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every winged bird of every kind. And God saw that it was good (Genesis 1:1-2, 20-21 ."</i><br> <font COLOR="#000000" >All of creation is a good gift of God, brought into glorious being out of nothingness and shaped out of chaos. All life, including human life, is created. It is finite, contingent, and limited and is sustained through God&rsquo;s loving care and attention, calling forth of new creation, moment-to-moment, in uncountable abundance in God&rsquo;s world. The tapestry of God&rsquo;s creation is woven with the beauty of extravagant diversity. From bacteria to begonias to our own lives, the diverse interconnected fabric of life calls forth our awe and wonder. <br> Human communities, in our incredibly diverse web of relationships, carry with them complex and widely differing traditions, (his/her) stories, and relationships with the rest of creation. In addition to nurturing the spirit, God&rsquo;s creatures provide nourishment and sustenance for each other in abundant and diverse ways. In human culture, hunting and gathering, plowing and planting, breeding and feeding, have grown in ways that reflect God&rsquo;s penchant for difference. The climates, soils and lands of different geographical regions differ dramatically in their ecologies. Farming, hunting, and other patterns for sustaining human life vary widely within countries and across the world. These differences also are a reflection God&rsquo;s gloriously expressed diversity. <br> <font COLOR="#000000">Reflecting on this diversity and the continuing presence of God&rsquo;s grace in our lives, United Methodists must address the threats to bio- and agricultural diversity posed by current activities in genetic engineering of plants and animals. These technologies are emerging within the context of a history of the overuse of land, the homogenization of agriculture, and the brutal exploitation of non-human animal life in search of ever higher profits.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> We have exploited God&rsquo;s soils, landscapes, plants, and animal life merely for their commercial value, forgetting our proper roles as limited, graced stewards of God&rsquo;s creation. Our relationship with creation is one of &ldquo;entrustment.&rdquo; And we have not fulfilled that trust. <br> Humans, and particularly North American agricultural practices have lost or obliterated strains of corn and apples, reduced the varieties of cattle and sheep to a virtual handful, bred chickens that do not ever get to walk, and turkeys so large they cannot even stand, much less fly. Multinational agri-business has sought to expand profits and control of agricultural practices by exporting such exploitative practices to peoples in the developing world. These practices have also threatened the diversity of the human community. The voices of farmers in such developing contexts urge North American Christians to seek repentance and wisdom as we embark on the next wave of bio-engineering: genetic modification. <br> Given this context, we urge extreme caution. <font COLOR="#000000" >The General Conference of The United Methodist Church in 2000 stated, &ldquo;At this point in human history, the human race is experiencing warning signs that our bodies and the natural environment have limits to their abilities to absorb and overcome the harm from some of our actions, technologies, and substances." (See &ldquo;Environmental Law-The Precautionary Principle.&rdquo;) Medical and scientific research is only beginning to identify the long-term synergistic effects of what we have done to our ecosystems and what we are doing to our food.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <font COLOR="#000000">Genetic modifications of plants, animals, and microbes must not speed the destruction of God&rsquo;s creation. With genomic technology, we are involved in the manipulation of life at a basic level. There may be possibilities for significant benefits<font COLOR="#800000">&nbsp; <font COLOR="#000000" >for humanity. There are also, perhaps even greater, possibilities<font COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;for unforeseen catastrophe. As finite recipients of God&rsquo;s grace and God&rsquo;s call to stewardship, we can only proceed with repentance for past transgression and a willingness to cultivate the crucial virtue of patience. <font COLOR="#000000" >We must proceed on the basis of faithful precaution, seeking God&rsquo;s help in discerning temptations to do apparent &ldquo;goods&rdquo; from faithful loving action as Jesus did in his sojourn in the desert (Luke 4: 1-44).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <font COLOR="#000000">Among the specific concerns that warrant our study and action are:<font COLOR="#000000" ><br> </font></b></b></i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" ></li></li><li><b><font FACE="Times New Roman">The distribution of genetically engineered grains to starving, impoverished, and war- ravaged peoples where the grain cannot be used later for crops to be sold in developed world markets. Many African countries that might receive genetically modified grain from the US would not<font COLOR="#800000">&nbsp; <font COLOR="#000000" >be able to later export that grain to Europe or Japan where genetically modified grain imports are restricted. They also may not be able to export the grain if the strains have been patented. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refusal by food donor nations to mill genetically modified grains before distribution so the grains&rsquo; seeds would not contaminate genetically engineered, organism-free ecosystems is an additional problem. <br>

Guidelines <br> It is possible to change the technology-driven direction of agriculture and rural development to one that is respectful and appreciative of creation as a gift of God that reflects our responsibilities as stewards and establishes right relationships of sustainability with creation. B<font FACE="Times New Roman">u<font FACE="Times New Roman">t we need guidelines. A sustainable agriculture must have three attributes: <br> (1) It must be just. A just society and a just agriculture provide the means whereby people can share in the inheritance of the earth so that all life can fully be maintained in freedom and community. The purpose of a just agriculture should be the maintenance and renewal of the necessary resources for food, clothing, and shelter, for now and for the future, recognizing the needs for space and sustenance of all of God&rsquo;s creatures. <br> (2) It must be participatory. For an agriculture to be just, everyone has the right to be consulted and the needs of all species to thrive be considered. Participation in human society and in the ongoing process of creation is the necessary condition for justice. Ethical human p<font FACE="Times New Roman">a<font FACE="Times New Roman">rticipation requires recognition of everyone&rsquo;s right to be consulted and understood, regardless of that person&rsquo;s economic, political, or social status. Participation is not possible without power. In such decision-making, everyone has the right to be consulted about such issues as expenditures for armaments, nuclear power, and forms of employment, social services, and so forth. <br> (3) It must be appropriate. Appropriate agriculture is appropriate to the region, context, and conditions of the area. It is one where the idea of permanent carrying capacity is maintained, where success (agriculture, energy production, forestry, water use, industrial activity) is measured by whether or not it sustains the soil and the ecosystems necessary to assure continuing supplies of healthful food. Rather than by the criteria of yields per acre or profits, appropriate agriculture ensures that waste products can be absorbed back into the ecosystem without damage. <br> Sustainable agriculture - just, participatory, and appropriate - would meet basic human needs for food and fiber, regenerate and protect ecosystems, be economically viable, enhance the quality of life for farm families, be supportive of rural communities, be socially just, and be compatible with spiritual teachings that recognize the earth as a common heritage and responsibility. For Christians, the idea of sustainability flows directly from the biblical call to human beings to be stewards of God&rsquo;s creation. <br> <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Be it resolved that: <br> </i><font FACE="Times New Roman">The General Board of Church and Society continue to monitor developments in this area, but especially advocate for the following: <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right of nations to set their own standards related to genetically modified organisms and their importation. <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Labeling of genetically modified organisms. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Testing of genetically modified organisms to assure their safety to human health and the environment. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That other agencies of the church work to educate about the concerns raised in this resolution.</b><font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
