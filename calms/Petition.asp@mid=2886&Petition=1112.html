<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >Overcoming Methodist Chauvinism <br> Methodist chauvinism continues to afflict our church and divide our membership.&nbsp;&nbsp;Methodist chauvinism is defined as "a religious parochialism known for its boundless praise of all things 'Methodist,' for ignoring Evangelical United Brethren sensitivities, and for seldom using the word 'United' in the phrase, "United Methodist,'" <br> We saw it at the 1964 and 1966 Methodist General Conferences where hundreds of delegates tried to amend the Plan of Union to rename the new church, "The Methodist Church," abrogating the plan's intention to form a new church from the two former bodies, a church "truly catholic, truly evangelical, and truly reformed." <br> When that attempt failed, Methodist chauvinists promoted the lie that "Methodist" was an acceptable abbreviation for "United Methodist" as Presbyterian" was then an acceptable abbreviation for "United Presbyterian."&nbsp;&nbsp;They ignored the reality that the usage is highly offensive to former Evangelical United Brethren who were not Methodists, never were Methodists, and had no intention of ever becoming Methodists. <br> The 1980 United Methodist General Conference, sympathetic toward Evangelical United Brethren sensitivities on this issue, moved Heritage Sunday from the anniversary of John Wesley's Aldersgate experience (the former Aldersgate Sunday) to the anniversary of the United Conference and passed a resolution on the "Proper Use of Name: The United Methodist Church."&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet Methodist chauvinists routinely violate the resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;They receive encouragement in this from religious and secular journalists whose habitual omission of "United" from "United Methodist," makes the usage seem acceptable. <br> Methodist chauvinism promotes a distorted view of church history.&nbsp;&nbsp;It imagines that the Wesleyan revival emerged solely from the genius of John Wesley.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, the Wesleyan revival was merely the British phrase of the international Pietist Reformation of which the Methodists, the Evangelical United Brethren, the Moravian Church, the Evangelical Covenant Church and the Evangelical Free Church and others are joint heirs. <br> Methodist chauvinism boasts of its support for civil rights, forgetting Methodism's one hundred fifty years of complicity with slavery and racism. <br> Methodist chauvinism boasts that such movements as the Salvation Army, the Holiness movement, and the Pentecostal movement sprang from Methodism's bosom.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Since these movements are Methodism's rejected offspring, this is like the Roman Catholic Church's taking credit for the genius of Martin Luther.)&nbsp;&nbsp;I this we mimic the Israelites whom Christ accused of building monuments to the prophets whom their parents murdered (Matthew 23:29-32). <br> Methodist chauvinism revel in its "doctrinal distinctives," ignoring John Wesley's assertion, in <i>The Character of a Methodist,</i> that "The distinguishing marks of a Methodist are not his opinions of any sort."&nbsp;&nbsp;Methodist chauvinism confuses "Wesleyan," the proper generic term for all movements embracing Wesley's theology, with its America hybrid, "Methodist," which combines this theology with the Episcopal ecclesiology of Francis Asbury. <br> Methodist chauvinism celebrates a distorted memory of John Wesley and distorts his teaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;It worships polity and "correct procedures" above truth. <br> By omitting the word "United" And giving needless offense, Methodist chauvinism ignores Paul's advice, "If it is possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all" (Romans 12:18), and commits sin. <br> So we call on the members and agencies of The United Methodist Church to repent of Methodist chauvinism in all its forms.&nbsp;&nbsp;We call our members to a more thorough understanding of the joint heritage of our Methodist and Evangelical United Brethren forebears and we call on our members and agencies to implement with energy and enthusiasm, the 1980 resolution on the "Proper Use of Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Methodist Church." <br> We call on our church periodical editors, where contributors omit the word "United" from "United Methodist" to correct this usage--both in articles and in letters to the editor.&nbsp;&nbsp;With direct quotations, they should insert "United" in brackets.&nbsp;&nbsp;They should further instruct advertisers that advertisements that refer to "Methodist" without "United" are unacceptable. <br> We further direct the General Commission on Communication, when it becomes aware of the omission of "United" from "United Methodist" in the church or secular press, to notify the responsible parties that this is unacceptable usage and to report to the Church annually in <i>The Interpreter </i>of its compliance with this directive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b><font FACE="Tahoma">
