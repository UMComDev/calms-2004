 <tr class="FAC-bodyoftable"><td colspan=2 bgcolor=#DDDaC8><b>Submitted Petition Text:</b><hr>
<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Add a new resolution to The Book of Resolutions as follows:<br> <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <font FACE="Times New Roman">The Minority Group Self Determination Fund&nbsp;&nbsp;(MGSDF) was established in 1970, two years after the Uniting Conference of The United Methodist Church authorized the formation of a General Commission on Religion and Race to succeed the Commission on Inter-Jurisdictional Relations, with responsibility for overseeing the mergers of racial conferences with geographical conferences. The original purpose of the fund was to enable an effective and just&nbsp;&nbsp;merger. However, very soon after its establishment, the General Commission on Religion and Race, the agency mandated by General Conference to administer the fund, declared that racism had victimized the Asian, Black, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and Native American populations and that these groups&nbsp;&nbsp;were disenfranchised and in need of economic justice, empowerment and self-determination. Therefore, the purpose of the Minority Group Self Determination Fund was redefined as follows: to empower the racial and ethnic constituency within the church and outside the church. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> During the last 34 years, the Minority Group Self Determination Fund has been instrumental for the empowerment of racial and ethnic minority persons in local churches and communities across the United States and Puerto Rico. The grants of the MGSDF have been the seed for programs which have furthered the racial and ethnic minority community in its pursuit for self-determination.&nbsp;&nbsp;Projects with the goals of economic development, better housing, transformed neighborhoods, better health care, education, just policies, and other social causes have benefited from the fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;The GCORR and The United Methodist Church have witnessed the transformation of communities made possible by the support given through the Minority Group Self Determination Fund (MGSFD).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Certainly the intentional work that has taken place in this country and in the church toward the eradication of racism and the subsequent empowerment of racial and ethnic minority persons has moved us farther in the journey. There has been great improvement in all areas of our life together, including economics. The economic gains are more visible through the media in the areas of sports and entertainment. Less visible but very real is the&nbsp;&nbsp;significant increase that has taken place of racial and ethnic minority leadership in positions of business and political leadership, as well as in professions such as law, medicine, and higher education. The increase in leadership is very visible in the church too.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even when the economic gain is a reality in the minority population, racial and ethnic minority groups remain seriously disadvantaged in the United States today. Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans figure among the poorest in the country with all the consequences that poverty implies. At a time of economic recess, racial and ethnic minority persons suffer the most. Currently, in the United States, in addition to alarming unemployment, increased&nbsp;&nbsp;crime, school drop-out rates, and lack of health care, we have witnessed a hostile attitude against immigrants and people of color who are residents or citizens of the United States. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The United Methodist Church has denounced racism as evil and sin and has committed itself to racial justice and inclusiveness. The Social Principles of our denomination declare the right of all persons to live fully as children of God. The Social Principles also claim &ldquo;all economic systems to be under the judgment of God no less than other facets of the created order&rdquo; (Social Principles. 163.IV. The Economic Community). The effects of racism in economics hinder the fullness of all people because their humanity is broken by the realities of poverty in all its social, psychological, physical, and spiritual consequences: poor education, unemployment, low self-esteem, violence, and injustice. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> During the 2000 General Conference The United Methodist Church publicly confessed the sin of racism, repented from it, and covenanted to begin a new reconciled life with the brothers and sisters who left the Methodist Church because of racism, and with all the racial and ethnic minority brothers and sisters who stayed in the church in spite of its racism and who have come to it during these past years.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Therefore: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, racism and poverty are intrinsically related because they exclude people from normal participation in the human community and make it difficult for them to become all that God has created them to be; and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, the current economic situation of the United States has impacted the racial and ethnic minority population which was already at a disadvantaged position in relationship to the majority population; and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, the economic situation has affected negatively the church&rsquo;s traditional funds for the racial and ethnic minority constituency such as the Ethnic Minority Local Church Funds in each of the program agencies, and specifically in the General Board of Global Ministries which has traditionally been a strong source of funding for ethnic minority empowerment and ministry; and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, the Minority Group Self Determination Fund is the only fund available in the church to which racial and ethnic minority local churches, community projects, jurisdictional groups, and national caucuses can recur directly; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, the Minority Group Self Determination Fund, 4 million for the quadrennium, is receiving more proposals than it can fund--for the period of 1999 to 2002, five hundred fifty-seven (557) applications were received and only two hundred eighteen (218) were funded making a total of $3,634,004.00);&nbsp;&nbsp;and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, The United Methodist Church has recommitted itself to rectify the errors of the past by confessing the sin of racism, repenting from it, and covenanting to seek the reconciliation that brings the fruits of justice and equality; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, economic justice is a concrete fruit of a renewed and reconciled church, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> We call the 2004 General Conference to enable the General Commission on Religion and Race in its ministry of empowerment and self-determination with all racial and ethnic minority groups by increasing the Minority Group Self Determination Fund to 8 million (2 million per year) for the 2005-2008 quadrennium.</b><font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
