<b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >Life Sustaining Measures in Health Care <br> I.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Situation <br> Advances in medical science have developed a number of medical treatments to sustain life, and treatments include:&nbsp;&nbsp;cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) - restoration of breathing or heartbeat; Intravenous (IV) therapy - providing water and/or medication through a vein; feeding tubes - nutritional support and hydration via artificial means; artificial respiration - mechanical breathe support; dialysis - a mechanical function that cleans the blood when the kidneys are no longer functioning; organ transplantation; and other surgical/medicinal treatments.&nbsp;&nbsp;These life-prolonging measures can be utilized in the event that a person is suffering from permanent brain damage; terminal illness; a coma; accident/acute illness that causes damage to vital organs are a few examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;The refusal or medications and simple treatments are also considered life sustaining measures, when persons are facing death without them. <br> II.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Theological Response <br> Scripture:&nbsp;&nbsp;Philippians 1:21-24 <br> For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which I prefer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hard pressed between the two:&nbsp;&nbsp;my desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better; but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Harper Collins Bible, NRSV, 1989) <br> I would interpret this scripture as meaning that there is no life apart from Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our responsibility as a Christian is to live and be fruitful in all the ways that God intended.&nbsp;&nbsp;If one chooses to continue to live with the use of life-sustaining measures, the question should be, "Can I still live a fruitful life in Christ with the use of life-sustaining measures?'&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, one may be on dialysis, which is a life sustaining measure, and can still live abundantly and be a faithful disciple that can share the glory of God with others.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if one is bedridden, non-communicative, and physically incapacitated, and is only a body sustained by medical technology, one may feel that death is a gain over a life of trouble and affliction.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last part of this scripture, "but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you," is a thought provoking question for the dying and family.&nbsp;&nbsp;"YOU" could be family that we feel death would hurt, merely because we are no longer physically present.&nbsp;&nbsp;The "you" could also mean remaining present to achieve God's purpose in life.&nbsp;&nbsp;This scripture with prayer can lead a dying person to discern God's will for life-sustaining choices. <br> Tradition:&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The 1996 Discipline </i>65L entitled "Death and Dignity" basically applauds medical science in efforts to sustain life.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this statement merely states that persons have a right to die with dignity without life sustaining measures, if they choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;This paragraph provides no statement of the church's role in the matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The 2000 Discipline </i>� 161L has basically the same wording, except it further emphasizes the importance of this matter and states the responsibility of the church as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;The paragraph is entitled, "Faithful Care of the Dying."&nbsp;&nbsp;This paragraph is more specific that the previous Disciplines.&nbsp;&nbsp;� 161L adds the following statements:&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the same time, care for the dying is part of our stewardship of the divine gift of life."&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second paragraph of 161L, the following is added:&nbsp;&nbsp;"We urge that decisions faced by the dying be made with thoughtful and prayerful consideration by the parties involved, with medical, pastoral, and other appropriate counsel.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when one ceases to resist death, the church and society must continue to provide faithful care, including pain relief, companionship, support, and spiritual nurture for the dying person in the hard work or preparing for death."&nbsp;&nbsp;These statements are just a few that were added that emphasize that the church has a responsibility to the dying, not just the physicians, their families, and friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;� 161L indicates that there is a significant role for the pastor and congregation in the process of dying.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel additional information is required to equip the church with basic knowledge of life sustaining options. <br> Polity:&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligation of servant leadership is the forming of Christian disciples in the covenant community of the congregation.&nbsp;&nbsp;This involves discerning and nurturing the spiritual relationship with God that is the privilege of all servant ministers.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also involves instructing and guiding Christian disciples in their witness to Jesus Christ in the world through acts of worship, devotion, compassion, and justice under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;John Wesley described this as "watching over one another in love."&nbsp;&nbsp;(2000 Discipline,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> � 136) <br> Experience:&nbsp;&nbsp;My experience in the health care field, as a health care provider, has given me first hand knowledge of the issues of life sustaining measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dying persons and their families need knowledgeable counselors to assist them in their time of need.&nbsp;&nbsp;The more we understand about the choices the dying are facing, the more compassionate we can be to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a person can live a fruitful life with some artificial feeding alternatives, and can lead a productive life with this life sustaining option.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a person on a respirator cannot live a normal productive life.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just two examples of how knowledge of the matter enhances one's ability to give counsel. <br> Reason:&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of those dying do not have Advance Directives, which are legal wishes of their health care plans in the event of a chronic illnesses or traumatic injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;The family is often left with the guilt of whether or not they will make/or have made the right decisions for their loved ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefit of being adequately aware may encourage those in our prayer community to prepare for making choices about life sustaining events whether or not they occur. <br> III Calls to Action <br> As United Methodists, we are called to provide care to the dying as part of our stewardship of the divine gift of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we challenge our membership to: <br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Support the medical community in providing life sustaining options. <br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide spiritual and emotional support to those individuals and families who utilize medical treatments or reject medical treatment in lieu of a decreased quality of life. <br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Educate our communities on the medical options available to sustain life, and encourage the use of advance directives (Health Care Wishes). <br> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Encourage individuals and their families to make informed decisions after thoughtful and prayerful consideration. <br> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggest counseling from the following people:&nbsp;&nbsp;a physician, a legal advisor, a medical-social worker, clergy, and family and friends. <br> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide a nurturing and compassionate environment for these individuals and their families throughout the life and death process.</b><font FACE="Tahoma">
