<P>Keeping your Web site updated with new information, stories, and articles is the best way to keep and grow your readership. UMC.org has developed a set of tools which allow church-related webmasters to utilize feature articles and even streaming media produced by the United Methodist Church on your own sites. These "syndication" tools give you the ability to offer fresh, updated content to your viewers without them ever leaving your site. Unlike a simple link to another site, you get the benefit of our authors producing the stories and articles, with the advantage of not loosing your readers to another site when they click on a link. Several pieces of syndication exist currently, and we are working to develop further offerings on a regular basis. Learn more about the following Web syndication items:</P><UL><LI><STRONG>The Upper Room� Daily Devotional</STRONG> - This application lets you display part of each day's meditation from The Upper Room� daily devotional. Select the parts you would like displayed and a Javascript string is created that you add to your website. Each day, your site is automatically updated with the current meditation. <A href="http://devotional.umcom.org/devotional">[sign-up]</A></LI></UL><!--<SCRIPT src="/forms/tools_syndications.asp" type=text/javascript></SCRIPT><NOSCRIPT>Enable JavaScript on your browser to see listing.</NOSCRIPT>--><P><STRONG>RSS</STRONG></P><P>Really Simple Syndication (RSS) allows you to quickly and easily add content from UMC.org to your Web site, news reader and Web logs (blogs). In time, UMC.org's library of RSS feeds will grow - enabling you to display, in real time, the latest UMC.org story headlines and short descriptions each linking back to the full story on UMC.org. </P><P>This is a free service of UMC.org. We ask that you not modify the feeds in any way.

Instead of being broadcast over the airwaves once and lost like with traditional radio. Podcasts are created to be stored and played at the user's convenience.
