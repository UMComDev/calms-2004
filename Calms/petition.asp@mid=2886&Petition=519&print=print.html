<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Paul reminded the divided Corinthians, <font FACE="Times New Roman">&ldquo;If one part (of the body) suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it&rdquo; <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">(</i>I Corinthians 12:25). It is in this spirit that the European community, its peoples and its churches, are gathering together to respond to a time of change and transformation--a time of alteration in Europe. <br> The fall of the Berlin wall (1989) was a symbol of a new political order in Europe. Since then, Europe has been in a process of change and transformation (alteration), which has led to both improvements and new challenges. The United Methodist Church recognizes with gratitude a trend to democratization and increased freedom in many countries as well as a development toward a larger community of European nations. We affirm that many people, among them numerous Christians including United Methodists, are now more vigilant in the journey of Europe toward &ldquo;An Area of Freedom, Security and Justice&rdquo; (expression from European Community Law). After September 11, 2001, people all over the world are more than ever experiencing a profound sense of vulnerability. As a people of faith we are recognizing that a shared vulnerability may become more important for mutual understanding and caring than privileged security of some. This shared vulnerability has helped us to see the European process of alteration in the context of an encompassing global transformation that in particular includes the continents of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. <br> A decade ago we rejoiced as we experienced great political changes in Central and Eastern Europe. Today it is clear that governments, the media, and the general public, including the churches, have underestimated the magnitude and the content of the problems encountered. Rising unemployment and the falling value of pensions and wages have plunged millions of people into poverty. A United Nations Development Report for Central and Eastern Europe shows that in 1989 about 14 million people in the former communist block lived on less than U.S. $4 a day. By the mid &lsquo;90s that number had risen to 147 million people. Only a small minority has participated in economic growth and development. In many places health care, schooling, and education standards declined dramatically whilst commerce-based criminality grew rapidly. <br> Given this situation, United Methodists, a minority among the churches in Europe, together with the other denominations emphasize the need for human development through witness for Jesus Christ and through working toward justice for the poor and vulnerable, for women and children, and for ethnic minorities especially the Romas and Sintis (Gypsies).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> United Methodists are together in mission to safeguard the local initiatives and dignity of clergy and lay missionaries, women and men, faithfully responding to the call of Jesus our Lord and Savior. We therefore affirm that church-planting, evangelism, and social initiatives in Eastern Europe, Russia, the Baltics, and the Balkans deserve continued support, spiritually and financially, by the larger Methodist family. Even if local churches may become financially self-sustaining and strong enough to continue the mission among the vulnerable and the poor on their own, it should not be forgotten that the Lord&lsquo;s commandment to mission is addressed to the whole Church. <br> We are thankful for the &ldquo;Fund Mission in Europe,&rdquo; a solidarity initiative of the European Methodist Council to collect financial resources among Methodist congregations in Western and Northern Europe for newly emerging churches and congregations in the East and in the South. The financial and spiritual support generated by local churches and conferences in the United States during the last ten years was an act of rescuing. <br> The Process of European Integration -- Hopes and Challenges&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The process of change, which aims to work for peace, stability and welfare, has been strengthened, especially by the European Union. The initiation of an unprecedented enlargement involving 13 new candidate countries is an ambition on a new level and on a new scale. Unfortunately, it has become clear that there is a widening gap between the expectations of tangible results on the one hand and loss of patience resulting from dissatisfaction with the actual process on the other hand. Particular challenges in this context are: <br> </font></b></b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2" ></li></li><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Transparency in the negotiating process <br></font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></li></li><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Free movement of persons and migration <br> <ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Human and social costs of the integration process </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Protection of the rights of minorities </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Preservation of indigenous (regional) cultures and identities </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Future borders of the European Union and relations with the new neighbors </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Commitment to common (Christian) values <br> </font></li></li></li></li></li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As United Methodists, we affirm that the European integration process is a sign of hope. We support efforts for the creation and development of independent regional cooperation and communities of nations, such as the European Union and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which includes the United States and Canada. At the same time, we are also aware of the dangers that continue to threaten the process toward a new Europe such as self-serving nationalism, serious economic problems and social upheaval. Against this background, the current priorities of The United Methodist Church's human rights program in the region includes the following: <br></font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2" ></li></li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Protection of refugees, migrants, asylum seekers and displaced peoples <br></font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></li></li><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Social policy questions in the transformation that nations make toward market economics&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Social rights for all, in particular respect and justice for women, children, and minorities </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Religious freedom </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Environmental and energy policies for a sustainable way of life <br> </font></li></li></li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The churches are not left untouched by the processes of political, economic, and cultural integration. The Conference of European Churches, together with the Roman Catholic Council of European Bishops Conferences, the Leuenberg Church Fellowship and the European Methodist Council, are very actively involved in internal and external processes of integration. In particular, the European Churches developed a &ldquo;Charta Oecumenica&rdquo; which is meant to be a helpful tool for dialogue and advocacy for the practical life together of the Orthodox, Protestant, Anglican, and Roman Catholic Churches. <br>  We believe and affirm that the churches in Europe have a message of hope. The new Europe cannot be built without them. The United Methodist Church is not nationally bound and is, therefore, particularly called upon to advance the goal of integration in the present European process of alteration. The worldwide United Methodist connection stands in solidarity with the churches in Europe in their journey towards making Europe a true area of freedom, security and justice.</b><font FACE="Tahoma">
