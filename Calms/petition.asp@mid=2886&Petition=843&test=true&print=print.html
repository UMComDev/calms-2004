<b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >WHEREAS, the United Methodist Board of Church and Society functions as the political lobby office of the United Methodist Church in the nation's capital; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, the Board and its staff takes sides on dozens of political issues every year, using, the name of our denomination to promote or oppose specific, controversial proposals before the U.S. Congress and the nation; and <br> WHEREAS, many of the positions of the Board and its staff are not based on the clear commands of Scripture, which should hold the highest authority among United Methodists; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, many of the positions of the Board and its staff also have dubious grounds in Christian tradition, reason, or experience which are recognized in our denomination as subordinate sources of ethical guidance; and <br> WHEREAS, the Board and its staff frequently take sides on issues on which there is not a consensus among United Methodists, or even takes positions that most church members would oppose; and <br> WHEREAS, the Board and its staff repeatedly goes beyond what is authorized by the United Methodist Social Principles and resolutions of the General Conference, injecting its own slanted political judgment; and <br> WHEREAS, in the latest case of abuse of its authority, the Board and its staff opposed the U.S. war against terrorism and misrepresented our denomination as a absolute pacifist church; and <br> WHEREAS, the Scriptures and the mainstream of Christian tradition recognize that government "does not bear the sword in vain, [it] is the servant of God to execute wrath on the wrongdoer" (Romans 13:4); and <br> WHEREAS, the United Methodist Social Principles deplore was but acknowledge that "force of arms may be preferable to unchecked aggression, tyranny and genocide;" and <br> WHEREAS, the Board and its staff often disregards these teachings of Scripture and our church and routinely misrepresents views of most United Methodists, and <br> WHEREAS, pronouncement by the Board and its staff can be a divisive force within our church; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> WHEREAS, thirty percent of the delegates voted to abolish the Board and its staff in a vote at the 2000 General Conference; and <br> THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that any public pronouncement by the Board of Church and Society and its staff may not supercede Scripture and the United Methodist Social Principles.</b><font FACE="Tahoma">
