<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >Amend resolution 201 as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><CENTER><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >201.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bread for the World <strike> Offering of Letters</strike>&nbsp;Covenant Church <br> </font></b></b></CENTER></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >In developing countries, 1.3 billion people (equaling the entire population of China) live in absolute poverty, with individual purchasing power equivalent to less than one U.S. dollar a day and 70 percent of childhood deaths are associated with malnutrition and preventable diseases. Approximately 35,000 children worldwide die each day from hunger-related causes, and another 841 million <strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">other </strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">people will suffer from malnutrition (Bread for the World Institute). <br> <b>There is significantly more hunger-related pain, suffering and death in the world than that caused by all the wars in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately 18 million people die each year from hunger, malnutrition and resulting diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the U.S., approximately 31 million people go to bed hungry a part of each month. <br> </b><strike> Helping hungry people is to Christian faith as breathing out is to breathing in, and the God of the Bible requires justice on the part of nations as well as individuals. God didn&rsquo;t send Moses to the courts of Pharaoh to take up a collection of canned goods and blankets. God sent Moses with a political message; to let the oppressed people of Israel go free. <br> The law that the Lord gave to Israel protected poor people. Courts were to treat poor people fairly, and farmers were to leave some grain unharvested for poor families. The prophets held kings and other leaders of the nation accountable for justice toward poor and vulnerable people: &ldquo;Woe to those who decree unjust laws, who write oppressive statutes, to turn aside the needy from justice, and to rob the poor of my people of their right. . .&rdquo; (Isaiah 10:1-2). <br> </strike> The prophets promised a messiah who would establish justice and the knowledge of God, and Jesus later announced himself as the fulfillment of those promises: &ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives. . .to set at liberty those who are oppressed . . .&rdquo; (Luke 4:18-21). <b>Jesus asked that we see that the hungry are fed (Matt. 25:35), and Jesus also said &ldquo;...in as much as you have done it unto the least of these, you have done it unto me&rdquo; (Matt. 25:40).</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </b>Jesus fed hungry people, befriended outcasts and called for radical sharing. He embodied forgiveness and mercy. Those of us who have been embraced by this &ldquo;good news&rdquo; are drawn to be concerned about people in need and we are compelled to work to make our society&rsquo;s laws fair and helpful toward poor and hungry people.... but also to work for policies that will end hunger and homelessness.&rdquo;<br> Bread for the World (BFW), established in 1974, is a nonprofit, non-partisan Christian citizens&rsquo; movement which performs a unique and critical role within the faith community by working to eradicate hunger from the face of the earth by using their network of thousands of local <strike> c</strike>&nbsp; <b>Covenant C</b>hurches across America to lobby elected officials <strike> on behalf of people who don&rsquo;t have enough to eat</strike>&nbsp; <b>to change policies to provide opportunities to establish a sustainable livelihood for all people</b>. <br> BFW&rsquo;s main campaign is an annual nationwide &ldquo;Offering of Letters,&rdquo; which not only provides church members with the opportunity to write members of Congress concerning hunger-related issues, but also enables congregations to incorporate into their worship experience, their passionate concerns for those that are starving and suffering from malnutrition. <br> <b>Covenant Church membership includes training, Bible study and worship aids (resources/materials) on the Christian response to world hunger. The BFW Covenant Church&nbsp;&nbsp;network (www.bread.org)&nbsp;&nbsp;is an essential&nbsp;&nbsp;component of the hunger program of The United Methodist Church, and its efforts complement UMCOR&rsquo;s (http://gbgm-umc.org/umcor)&nbsp;&nbsp;and the General Board of Church and Society&rsquo;s ministry (http://umc-gbcs.org) in alleviating the root causes of hunger/poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct feeding (soup kitchens) provides relief one day at a time (and may always be needed) but does little to eradicate causes of hunger. Holistic spirituality and development (putting love in action) prepares persons for sustainable livelihoods, but only if government policies are changed to permit this.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bread for the World Covenant Church program provides opportunities to change government policies. Bread for the World works, but more grassroots initiative is needed. Otherwise, at the current rate of change, between 1.5 and 2 billion people will die during the next 75 years due to hunger/malnutrition. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> BFW&rsquo;s Covenant Church program focuses on an annual nationwide &ldquo;Offering of Letters&rdquo; and helps prepare United Methodists to effectively change public policy through new legislation each year. <br> </b><br> The United Methodist Church, along with more than 45 denominations and church agencies, generously supports BFW, and in fact, The United Methodist Church has a 25-year history of collaboration with BFW&rsquo;s fight against the root causes of both global and domestic hunger. <b>The United Methodist Advance Special Number is: 982325-3.</b> BFW has said that, &ldquo;[It] owes much to Methodism&rsquo;s historic commitment to social justice and active concern for the poor and downtrodden. John Wesley&rsquo;s conviction that `the world is my parish&rsquo; is at the heart of BFW&rsquo;s work,&rdquo;<br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that The United Methodist Church <strike> encourage its members to support Bread for the World, and urge all local churches to celebrate an annual &ldquo;Offering of Letters,&rdquo; for as long as God&rsquo;s children go hungry</strike>&nbsp; <b>significantly enhance its efforts to END HUNGER by increasing participation in the Bread for the World (BFW) Covenant Church program. We further urge that The United Methodist Church achieve a minimum of a 5 percent increase in the number of churches participating in the BFW Covenant Church program each year. <br> </b>. <br> </font><p align="right"><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="1" >ADOPTED 2000 <br> </font></b></b></p></b><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >See</i> Social Principles, � 163<i>D </i>and<i> E.</i><font FACE="Tahoma">
