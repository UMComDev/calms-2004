<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >We affirm that the right to communicate and to access information is a&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> basic human right, essential to human dignity and to a just and democratic society. <br> Our understanding of communication is grounded in scripture. God is a communicating God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Christians believe that the creation of the world is rooted in the spoken Word of God. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God made all persons in the divine image. God created the world and all living things for relationship. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bible is the inspired word of God about communication and a God who created the world and all living things for relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The biblical account of the tower of Babel presents a classic example of the integral relationship between communication and being human<font FACE="Times">.<font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This theme repeats itself in the story of Pentecost, the birthplace of the church. Being filled with the Holy Spirit and in communion with God and one another, the people of God spoke and heard the divine message of God in their own languages. We acknowledge that every right brings with it responsibilities. The whole community - owners, managers and consumers - is responsible for the functioning of communication in society.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christians have an obligation to advocate that mass media and communication&nbsp;&nbsp;technologies are operated to serve the public good rather than merely commercial interests. <br> </font></b></b><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Most peoples of the world have no access to even the most rudimentary communication technologies - telephones, radio - much less the digital, satellite and other technologies that are rapidly expanding in the developing world. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >These technologies allow their owners to manage information and resources at increasingly remote distances from the local cultures and economies affected. The instantaneous nature of global data transmission means that economic powers often have access to information before others do. The global-technological nature of the economy gives tremendous fiscal power to these same developed world and transnational interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> This system works to advance the cause of the global market and promote commercial values aimed only at profit, often neglecting the aspects of communication and culture that promote the common good. Media companies, as producers and carriers of information, have a far-reaching effect on value formation. <br> Issues of justice in local and national development cannot be addressed without a consciousness of the role of communication, nor can any people do so without the tools with which to make their views known. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) offer enormous benefits. They enable global contact and, when made available for human uses and to address human needs, can significantly enhance life, development, and global consciousness. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Such uses will not become widespread unless concrete enabling steps are taken. Therefore the church&rsquo;s voice is crucial. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The church continues its mission and ministry amid this enormous revolution in communication. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >The church quickly embraced the first communication revolution, the invention of the printing press, and used the printed word to disseminate the written word and to teach literacy to millions who were otherwise considered unfit to learn, empowering them to fully engage in the world. <br> The education of his neighbors was a matter close to John Wesley&rsquo;s heart, and his efforts gave many the education necessary to read and understand the gospel of Jesus Christ and to interpret the events of their world in the light of the gospel. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >The Church carries a responsibility for helping its members achieve media literacy, not only to read and understand the gospel but also to discern from the flood of information an understanding of the events of our world today. Citizens cannot get responsible political information without media literacy. The current media revolution challenges all people to resist becoming mere consumers of messages that are created and controlled by a relatively small number of super-powerful transnational media corporations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Media technologies have great potential to bind the world together, when not beholden entirely to transnational commercial interests. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Therefore, The United Methodist Church commits to: <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
