<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT" SIZE="3" ><br> <b></i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT">Report No. 11 <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT"><br> <b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT">REPORT ON STRENGTHENING THE BLACK CHURCH FOR THE 21<font SIZE="1">ST <font SIZE="3">CENTURY <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Backgound and Mandate <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT"><br> The initiative, Strengthening the Black Church for the 21<font SIZE="1">st <font SIZE="3">Century (SBC-21), was established by actions <br> of the 1996 General Conference. The 2000 General Conference approved continuance of SBC-21 as a <br> major program initiative. The initiative called for the establishment of a 23-member Coordinating <br> Committee to oversee the implementation of the Plan of Action for the initiative. The Coordinating <br> Committee would continue to be accountable to the General Council on Ministries (GCOM) for <br> administration; accounting and fund allocation in response to the budgetary decisions made by the <br> Coordinating Committee; annual progress reports; and a plan of evaluation. The Coordinator would <br> continue to be an employee of GCOM and covered by all GCOM personnel policies and practices. <br> <b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT"><br> Process and Implementation <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">The first quadrennial meeting of the Coordinating Committee, which included general agency resource <br> persons, was held in Jacksonville, Florida, February 23-25, 2001. Bishop Jonathan D. Keaton is the <br> chairperson for this initiative. <br> Progress reports have been shared with GCOM to keep them abreast of the work of the Coordinating <br> Committee and to explore ways to provide ongoing support and assistance. GCOM has been an advocate and <br> supportive partner for the initiative. <br> The goal of SBC-21 is to offer The United Methodist Church the gift of a transformational learning model <br> that enables one congregation to share its gift of vitality with other churches wanting to expand their gifts <br> in mission and ministry; and in the process, to revitalize Black congregations and The United Methodist <br> Church. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The fulfillment of this goal included the following: <br> <font FACE="Symbol">&#9830; <b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT">The Congregation Resource Centers <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">Maintained a level of twenty-two (22) Congregation Resource Centers (CRC) housed in vital Black churches <br> located across the five jurisdictions. CRCs fulfilled their role as the primary place for training lay and clergy <br> teams, and establishing a covenant relationship with partner churches for congregational revitalization. <br> <font FACE="Symbol">&#9830; <b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT">Developed Clergy & Lay Resource Leadership Teams <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">Congregation Resource Center Training Summit developed for lay and clergy teams consisting of specialists in <br> the areas of administration and the design of SBC-21 training events. Intensive training was provided on how <br> to conduct training events on-site for partner congregations. A revised training manual was introduced to <br> guide lay/clergy teams in the design of training events built around the goals of the Initiative. <br> <font FACE="Symbol">&#9830; <b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT">The Partner Congregations <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">By the end of quadrennium, development of over 700 partner congregations located in rural, urban, and <br> suburban areas needing assistance and resources. Training models for partner churches were designed around <br> (a) vibrant & varied worship; (b) leadership development; (c) faith formation; (d) mission and outreach; and (e) <br> planning & administration. <br> <font FACE="Symbol">&#9830; <b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT">Great Event Training Model <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">Great Event Training Model, a national gathering of pastors and laity, was developed and introduced in 2003 <br> as an alternative model for enlisting partner congregations at the beginning of the process of developing a <br> covenant relationship with congregation resource centers. <br> <font FACE="Symbol">&#9830; <b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT">Follow-Up Component <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">Developed and implemented a follow-up component designed to engage with partner churches on specialized <br> needs at the partner church site, evaluate learnings and encourage continuing collaboration with the <br> congregation resource center. Part-time consultant hired to guide work of follow-up strategies. <br> <font FACE="Symbol">&#9830; <b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT">Communication & Interpretation of SBC-21 <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">Production of SBC-21 video on how the initiative has impacted partner congregations and community. Website <br> created so that lay & clergy could log on and read about the initiative and link to other related web sites <br> and resources. SBC-21 newsletters and other church publications celebrated and widely disseminated the <br> stories of congregational renewal, bold and meaningful ministries. New visions, new life, new beginnings, and <br> new stories of hope and possibilities are emerging from SBC21 training experiences and follow up activities. <br> The general agencies and commissions of The United Methodist Church worked closely with the initiative as <br> they served as consultants to the Coordinating Committee. In this relationship, they provided many services, <br> collaborated with SBC-21 in its programs and training and utilized in their own meetings and programs the <br> resources of SBC-21. Black Methodists for Church Renewal, jurisdictions and annual conferences were also <br> energized and involved in the initiative. <br> Financially supported by an action of General Conference in the amount of $2,080,000, SBC-21 is a Special <br> Project for the Advance for Christ and His Church. <br> The initiative is intended as a gift to the denomination. It is built on the core value that Christ is our Center for <br> Hope, Healing, and Wholeness. The work of the initiative is grounded in the scripture, history and traditions of <br> The United Methodist Church and a Black people with a strong history and faith. Using our God-given gifts to <br> provide leadership to strengthen Black churches in particular, all churches in general, is a model of faithful <br> stewardship. <br> <i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT"><br> </i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">All that has been planned and accomplished is within the guidelines and mandate of the United Methodist <br> Social Principles. This initiative is fulfilling Christ&rsquo;s mission in the life of The United Methodist Church. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Signed: _______________________________________ <br> Bishop Edward W.
