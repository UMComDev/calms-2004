<font FACE="Times New Roman" >
</font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Revitalizing The United Methodist Church: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The United Methodist Church has a long, rich tradition in American higher education.&nbsp;&nbsp;American Methodism has been committed to education since its inception. At the Christmas Conference of 1784, the first action was the election of a bishop and the establishment of Cokesbury College in Abingdon, Maryland. This action was symbolically and substantively important because the conference unquestionably spoke and acted on two high priority items. One was leadership (electing the bishop), and the other was program (establishing Cokesbury College). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Soon thereafter, newly elected Bishop Francis Asbury wrote to all Methodists, reminding them of their obligation to erect a school in the vicinity of every church, &ldquo;to give the key of knowledge in a general way to your children, and those of the poor in the vicinity of your small towns and villages.&rdquo;</sub><sup>1 </sup></sub>Bishop Asbury set the church-wide vision &ldquo;to give the key of knowledge&rdquo; as a program priority, and securing local church resources &ldquo;to erect a school in the vicinity of every church.&rdquo; Thus, &ldquo;millions of working-class Methodists gave their nickels, dimes, and crumpled dollar bills . . . to the apportionments and special appeals that built our hospitals, orphanages and colleges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivated by their commitment to Christ, ordinary people made extraordinary sacrifices to accomplish visionary goals.&rdquo;</sub><sup>2</sup></sub><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The United Methodist education pipeline became an integral part of the Connectional System. The pipeline is leadership development, and it must start in the local church, continue in the schools, colleges, universities, theological schools and campus ministry units and then produce leaders for the church and world. Local churches, together with scholarship support, sent their youth to our colleges and universities. World-class graduates, equipped with general and professional education, were gushing out of the United Methodist education pipeline and became leaders in the church and the world. In the early 1960s, however, The United Methodist Church&rsquo;s program priorities shifted away from education, and today, the historic partnership between church and campus has been weakened therefore contributing to the erosion and rusting of the pipeline. </b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b></b><b><i><font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif" SIZE="3" >The pipeline has eroded and rusted as there are fewer young people in the church and the leadership pool is dwindling. We struggle to get the best and brightest for clergy as research shows there are declining numbers of clergy with MDIVs; there is a small percentage of students entering college who plan to attend seminary; and there are fewer young people who see ordination as elder as a significant vocation.</b></i><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> </font></b></b></i></i><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >It is very alarming to review the membership composition of The United Methodist Church in the United States, for these data further explains how the pipeline is rusted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership below the age of 18 consists of only 4.6% (or 383,000), while membership above the age of 40 consists of 80.1%.&nbsp;&nbsp;The average age of church members is 57 years old. Only 9.9% of clergy members are below the age of 39. Of 8,292,809 members of The United Methodist Church, Asian Americans comprise only 0.8%, African Americans 5.1%, Hispanic Americans 0.6%, Native Americans 0.2%, Pacific Islanders 0.1%, and white Americans 93.2%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the clergy members, Asian Americans comprise 2.2%, African Americans 5.6%, Hispanic Americans 1.2%, Native Americans 0.4%, Pacific Islanders 0.3%, and white Americans 90.4%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Female clergy members comprise only 18.5% of 44,539 clergy members, while 63% of the members of the church are females.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In facing this reality, we must ask, &ldquo;What is the future of The United Methodist Church?&rdquo; In order to resolve this most urgent issue, The United Methodist Church must have a clear vision, dynamic leadership, purposeful and focused programs, and faithful stewardship, such as the early Methodists had at the 1784 Christmas Conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The General Board of Higher Education and Ministry (GBHEM) proposes that the 2004 General Conference adopt the following strategic vision and goals as a denominational priority:</b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b></b><b><font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif" SIZE="3" >Vision</b><font FACE="Tms Rmn"><br> </font></b></b><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >A new generation of Christian leaders will commit boldly to Jesus Christ and be characterized by intellectual excellence, moral and spiritual courage, and holiness of heart and life.</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b></b><b><font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif" SIZE="3" >Goal 1</b><font FACE="Tms Rmn"><br> </font></b></b><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >The United Methodist Church, throughout its connection, will identify, recruit, educate, and prepare young people for Christian vocations with a special focus on first generation United Methodists. </b><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b></b><b><font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif" SIZE="3" >Goal 2</b><font FACE="Tms Rmn"><br> </font></b></b><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >The United Methodist Church, throughout its connection, will collaborate with United Methodist-related schools, colleges, universities, theological schools, and campus ministry units to build a new education pipeline that will generate dynamic leaders for the church and world. </b><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b></b><b><font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif" SIZE="3" >Goal 3</b><font FACE="Tms Rmn"><br> </font></b></b><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >The United Methodist Church, throughout its connection, will embrace its tradition of excellent, educated leadership by sharing success stories from its ministries in higher education, theological education, and campus ministry in ways that create a desire to be a part of its vibrant ministries.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> We urge the 2004 General Conference to approve this resolution for the purpose of revitalizing The United Methodist Church and to mandate that the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry be fully responsible for implementing the resolution.</b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </sub><sup>1 </sup></sub>Elliott, T.
