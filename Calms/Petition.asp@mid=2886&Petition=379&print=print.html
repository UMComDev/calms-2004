<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >HUMAN RIGHTS IN PAKISTAN <br> </font></b></b><b></CENTER></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Pakistan is ruled by a military government headed by General Perfez Musharraf. A referendum approving his continued rule was passed ostensibly with over 97 percent of the vote in 2002. Non-Muslims cannot hold senior office. According to international human rights groups, including Amnesty International, the government curbs freedom of speech on subjects such as the military, the courts, the constitution, and religion. Blasphemy laws prohibit any criticism of Islam and call for a mandatory death sentence. Christians, Hindus, and other religious minorities are subject to government restrictions and societal persecution. Islamic law courts call for Koranic punishments of some crimes, such as stoning for adulturers. Although federal authorities rarely if ever levy such punishments, local communities sometimes do. Open evangelism among Muslims is illegal. The rights of women, especially when under the authority of tribal leaders, are especially vulnerable. Torture is used by police and security services, against both criminals and political opponents. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>THE ISSUES <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Freedom of Speech</b> - The government may act against any speech that violates Islamic principles. Any activity, under the Anti-Terrorist Law, including speech that is perceived as stirring up religious strife, is punishable by up to seven years of imprisonment. All senior officials are required to sign an oath swearing they will uphold the Islamic ideology of the country. Laws intended to defend Islam are often a pretext to silence or neutralize opponents of the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Free Elections</b> - Opposition parties function and hold numerous seats in the National Assembly. Independent media also function, especially newspapers. But much of the opposition is Islamist and favors even more stringent enforcement of Islamic law than Musharraf&rsquo;s government would prefer. President Musharaff reserves the right to dismiss the National Assembly and all regional assemblies.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Religious Freedom</b> -Though Christianity and other religious minorities are tolerated, the constitution mandates the death sentence for the defamation of the name of Muhammad. This punishment is rarely if ever directly used by the federal government. But it serves to intimidate non-Muslim minorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Missionaries must obtain a special Visa, which is valid for a period of 2 to 5 years and allows only one entry into the country per year. Proselytizing by missionaries is permitted as long as the missionaries publicly admit that they are not Muslim and whatever they preach about does not contradict Islam. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Discrimination in employment based upon religious affiliation is widespread. Christians in particular have difficulty finding employment in professional positions. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In courts of law, testimony by Christians, especially Christian women, is deemed less reliable than testimony by Muslims. In tribal areas of Pakistan, tribal leaders employ Islamic law to impose often harsh Koranic punishments for sexual misbehavior and blasphemy. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Attacks by Islamic militants against Christians and other minorities are illegal, but perpetrators are rarely arrested, tried, and convicted. Islamic religious schools continue to provide ideological training and motivation for discrimination against and attacks on non-Muslims. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The public display of images of Jesus Christ and the Holy Trinity are restricted by the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Pakistani law prevents the Ahmadi religious community from calling themselves Muslim even though they regard themselves as Muslim. Claiming to be Muslim can earn imprisonment of up to three years for an Ahmadi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <b>Rights of Women</b> - Women and girls are subjected to abuses both communally and within the private home. Often women are murdered by relatives in &ldquo;honor killings&rdquo; for marital infidelity, refusing to submit to an arranged marriage, divorce, flirting with or receiving phone calls from men, failing to serve a meal on time, or "allowing herself" to be raped.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The law of qisas and diyat regarding murder permits prosecution only with permission from the victim&rsquo;s family, which effectively allows honor killings to go unpunished.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Girls and women are often trafficked and subject to arranged marriages, prostitution, or exploitative work. Without assistance from law enforcement, they are likely to endure physical, mental, and sexual abuse, having no options of seeking justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Other difficulties are common for Pakistani women. Women, for example, are not supposed to patronize male doctors. In many areas, however, female doctors are not available; and so women are denied medical treatment altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Although federal law gives women the franchise, many village elders prevent women from voting and fine men who &ldquo;allow&rdquo; their female relations to vote.<b><font SIZE="3"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> OUR RESPONSE <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b><font SIZE="3">The United Methodist Church calls for greater protection of basic human rights and the expansion of democratic liberties in Pakistan. We pray for all Pakistanis, especially for the church in Pakistan. In particular, we pray for full religious freedom, a free press, free elections, equal rule of all for all people, and the abolition of torture. We shall be an advocate for human rights and democratic reforms within Pakistan in our interactions with the U.S. government and other governments, with ecumenical organizations, and directly with the Pakistani government, when possible. We stand in solidarity with human rights organizations in Pakistan.<font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
