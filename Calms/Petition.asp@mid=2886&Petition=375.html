 <tr class="FAC-bodyoftable"><td colspan=2 bgcolor=#DDDaC8><b>Submitted Petition Text:</b><hr>
<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >HUMAN RIGHTS IN SUDAN <br> </b><br> Since seizing power in 1989, Lt. General Omar Hasan Ahmad el Bashir and his National Islamic Front (NIF) have ruled Sudan. According to international human rights groups such as Amnesty International, the Sudanese government conducts arbitrary arrests, detentions without trial, and torture. Islamic law, with its severe punishments that include stonings and amputations, is imposed. Political opponents of the regime are routinely harassed. Christians, moderate Muslims, and other religionists are persecuted. In its war to suppress the largely non-Muslim southern part of the country, the regime has conducted massacres, ethnic cleansing, deliberate targeting of civilian targets, and has withheld humanitarian aid. Government troops abduct women and children to sell into the slave trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>THE ISSUES <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Freedom of Speech - </b>All media are subject to censorship. Journalists who criticize the government&nbsp;&nbsp;have been fined, have had their publications seized, have been arrested, and have been sentenced to death. The media are also prevented from reporting comprehensively about AIDS, female circumcision, and the slave trade in Sudan. Freedoms of association and assembly are sharply restricted. There are no independent labor unions. Opposition leaders and student activists have been detained and tortured after criticizing the government. Anti-government demonstrators have been shot at by police with live bullets.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Free Elections - </b>President Bashir won an election in 2000 with 86 percent of the vote.&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposition parties boycotted the election, saying it was rigged. Two-thirds of the parliament faced no opposition. After the election, the government reinstated a state of emergency and governs as a dictatorship. Political parties that are critical of the government are banned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Political Prisoners - </b>Regime opponents are often held incommunicado, without access to lawyers, many held without charges, and many subject to torture and other degrading treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some are held in secret &ldquo;ghost houses.&rdquo; The National Security Forces Act allows the security forces to detain people incommunicado for up to nine months without charge. Besides journalists, students, political leaders, and human rights advocates, the regime has detained many community leaders of Fur, Zaghawa, or Masalit ethnicity on suspicion of support for armed opposition. <br> </font></b></b><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Religious Freedom - </b>Islam is the de facto state religion. The government often closes or destroys churches, especially in the non-Muslim south. Permits for new church construction are very difficult to obtain. Evangelism and conversion away from Islam are illegal. Forced conversions to Islam are encouraged by government policies. Up to one-third of Sudan is non-Muslim, mostly Christian. Churches include the Roman Catholic, Coptic, Anglican, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, and others. Most, but not all, Christians are black African.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Muslims are oriented towards Arab culture. Non-Muslims experience discrimination in government employment, education, and housing. Observance of the sabbath is often forbidden or made difficult. The government has declared its war against the non-Muslim south to be a Muslim holy war.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b></b><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Rights of Women - </b>Under Islamic law, women face discrimination and unequal treatment laws about marriage, divorce, and inheritance. Women are subjected to harsh punishments for adultery. Some decrees have attempted to regulate women&rsquo;s attire. Female genital mutilation is illegal but still common. In the war zone, women and young girls are commonly raped and abducted by government troops.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>OUR RESPONSE <br> </b><br> The United Methodist Church calls for the creation and protection of basic human rights and&nbsp;&nbsp;democratic liberties in Sudan. We pray for all Sudanese, especially for the church in Sudan. In particular, we pray for an end to war, full religious freedom, a free press, free elections, equal rule of all for all people, and the abolition of torture. We shall be an advocate for human rights and democratic reforms within Sudan and in our interactions with the U.S. government and other governments, with ecumenical organizations, and directly with the Sudanese government, when possible. We stand in solidarity with all persecuted persons in Sudan.<font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
