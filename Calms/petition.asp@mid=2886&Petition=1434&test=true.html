<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >A RESOLUTION OF CONCERN <br> </font></b></b><b></CENTER><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Whereas, eight General Conferences over 28 years have consistently maintained a balanced and compassionate approach to ministry for and with homosexuals:&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Homosexual persons no less than heterosexual persons are individuals of sacred worth ... Although we do not condone the practice of homosexuality and consider this practice incompatible with Christian teaching, we affirm that God&rsquo;s grace is available to all.&rdquo; (�161G) <br> Whereas, in response to passionate advocacy from those who disagree with this position, the General Conference has consistently refused to allow the ordination or appointment of &ldquo;self-avowed practicing homosexuals,&rdquo; has refused to allow General Church funds to be used &ldquo;to promote the acceptance of homosexuality,&rdquo; and has refused to allow United Methodist clergy to perform same-gender unions or use United Methodist churches to host such services. (�304.3, 806.9, 332.6) <br> Whereas, the clergy covenant agreed to by all clergy entering the denomination includes the following question: &ldquo;In covenant with other elders, will you be loyal to The United Methodist Church, accepting its order, liturgy, doctrine, and discipline, defending it against all doctrines contrary to God&rsquo;s Holy Word, and accepting the authority of those who are appointed to supervise your ministry?&rdquo; (The United Methodist Book of Worship, p. 676, c.f. p. 666, also c.f. Discipline �304.1i) <br> </CENTER> Whereas, the Judicial Council has ruled (JC Decision 886) that &ldquo;When a clergy person engages in mission and ministry in The United Methodist Church, that clergy person covenants to perform his/her duties in accord with the provisions of the Discipline ... This paragraph [331.3(c)] is specific in stating that a clergy person has the responsibility of adhering to the provisions of the Discipline and to assure that those for whom he/she has administrative responsibility do the same ... This decision makes it clear that all entities of the Church are bound by the provisions of the Discipline, and that no entity or individual member of the Church has the right to negate or ignore the Discipline ... The Discipline is the law of the Church which regulates every phase of the life and work of the Church. As such, annual conferences may not legally negate, ignore, or violate provisions of the Discipline with which they disagree, even when the disagreements are based upon conscientious objections to those provisions.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of the Judicial Council sets an example of such integrity in her concurring opinion on Judicial Council Decision 980.&nbsp;&nbsp;She states, &ldquo;I feel it necessary to state that I do not agree with the Discipline on this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that we as a Judicial Council have the authority to change the Discipline ... and must uphold it in its present form in our official capacity.&rdquo;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Whereas, the 2000 Western Jurisdictional Conference passed a resolution entitled, &ldquo;We Will Not Be Silent,&rdquo; including the following statement, &ldquo;Affirming the statement of United Methodist of Color for a Fully Inclusive Church, &lsquo;We acknowledge that there may be differences of opinion among us, but this does not require that we wait on justice.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot accept discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered persons and, therefore, we will work toward their full participation at all levels in the life of the church and society.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least one annual conference has endorsed this statement. <br> </CENTER> Whereas, the 2000 &ldquo;New England Declaration&rdquo; and &ldquo;Desert Southwest Declaration,&rdquo; signed by clergy and laity in those areas, include the following statements:&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;WE AFFIRM human sexuality and understand homosexuality, heterosexuality and bi-sexuality to be good gifts of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;We commit to proclaim that homosexuality (no less or more than heterosexuality) is compatible with Christian teaching ... As clergy we will preach this from our pulpits and expose our parishioners to the fullness of the Scriptural witness on related matters in our Bible studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;As lay people we will teach it in our Sunday school classes and tell it to our children.&nbsp;&nbsp;WE AFFIRM that loving, monogamous, intimate relationships between person of the same or opposite gender, are an expression of God&rsquo;s love ... We will also enable all couples to celebrate rites of union, regardless of gender ... We will support the use of our buildings for celebrations of persons covenanting to love one another as life-partners ... As clergy we will affirm God&rsquo;s call to ordained ministry as experienced by candidates for ministry regardless of a person&rsquo;s sexual orientation and welcome them into the clergy covenant.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2003 session of the Northern Illinois Annual Conference approved a resolution containing similar language. <br> Whereas, clergy and laity have endorsed the 2002 &ldquo;Phoenix Declaration,&rdquo; which states: &ldquo;Homosexuality is not a sickness, not a choice, and not a sin. We affirm that GLBT persons are distinctive, holy, and precious gifts to all who struggle to become the family of God. We stand in solidarity as those who are committed to work and pray for full acceptance and inclusion of GLBT persons in our churches and in our world.&rdquo;<br> Whereas, in 2002 two committees on investigation in the Pacific Northwest Annual Conference, as well as the jurisdictional committee on appeals, refused to advance a complaint against clergypersons who openly and publicly declared themselves to be &ldquo;self-avowed practicing homosexuals,&rdquo; such that an appeal to Judicial Council was necessary to enforce the Discipline. <br> Therefore, be it resolved, that the 2004 General Conference declares its concern over agencies, leaders, and members of The United Methodist Church who fail to uphold and enforce the Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church, or who willfully disobey it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such statements and actions as noted above are potentially corrosive to the covenantal unity of the church and undermine the integrity of both the institution and its members.&nbsp;&nbsp;We respectfully urge our brothers and sisters who may disagree with the clearly stated position of The United Methodist Church to honor and comply with the provisions of the Discipline and the actions of General Conference as a matter of intellectual honesty and moral commitment to promises made.&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask you to consider the final direction in John Wesley&rsquo;s historic questions (� 327): &ldquo;And do not mend our rules, but keep them; not for wrath, but for conscience&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;</b><br> <font FACE="Tahoma">
