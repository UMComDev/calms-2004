<i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> <b></i>Report No. 6 <br> </b>Petition Number: <br> <br> <b> REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON SPECIAL DAYS <br> Background and Mandate <br> </b>The General Council on Ministries (GCOM) has the responsibility <i>&ldquo;to recommend to the General <br> Conference, after consultation with the Council of Bishops, the number and timing of special <br> days which are to be observed on a churchwide basis;&rdquo; (The Book of Discipline, 2000, � 906.7)</i>. <br> The General Council on Finance and Administration (GCFA) has the responsibility <i>&ldquo;to make <br> recommendations to the General Conference, in consultation with the General Council on <br> Ministries and the Council of Bishops, regarding any offerings to be received in connection with <br> special days observed on a churchwide basis. These recommendations shall include the number <br> and timing of such special days with offerings, the amount, if any...&rdquo; (The Book of Discipline, <br> 2000, � 807.3) <br> <b></i>Process <br> </b>A consultation on special Sundays was co-sponsored by the GCFA and GCOM in October 2002. <br> The consultation included selected members from the two Councils, representatives from the <br> general agencies and the Council of Bishops, and other interested parties. The consultation <br> included reports on the financial giving for the special Sundays with churchwide offering, the <br> promotion and interpretation provided by United Methodist Communications, and reports on all <br> special Sunday observances by the general agencies responsible for their administration. A <br> request was received from the General Commission on Archives and History to change the <br> observance date for Heritage Sunday to Aldersgate Day (May 24<font SIZE="1">th<font SIZE="3">) or the Sunday preceding. The <br> General Commission on United Methodist Men brought a proposal for a United Methodist Men&rsquo;s <br> MENistry Sunday, and the General Board of Pension and Health Benefits brought a report from <br> the Global Pensions Task Force to a possible request for a special Sunday dedicated to global <br> pensions that would give individual United Methodists at all levels an opportunity to both support <br> and participate in the global pensions system. Correspondence was also received from United <br> Methodists expressing concern over the number of special Sundays, and recommending that no <br> more be added. The GCFA and GCOM task force members observed that most annual <br> conferences have designated additional special Sunday observances, and it is difficult for United <br> Methodist members and pastors to distinguish those set by the General Conference from those <br> approved by annual conferences and other church bodies. <br> The GCFA and GCOM task force members agreed to recommend the change in observance date <br> for Heritage Sunday, but felt that other requests should only be recommended after General <br> Conference had acted to approve such observances. <br> The task force members requested that the report to General Conference include the achievements <br> of the special Sundays and to help United Methodists to learn about available responses to <br> promote and enhance their observance. <br> <i><br> <b></i>The Significance and Achievements of Special Sundays <br> </b>Special Churchwide Sundays with Churchwide Offerings <br> 1. <i>Human Relations Day <br> </i><font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Significant way to demonstrate how local congregations and community groups are <br> engaged in ministry in their communities and in the world. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Through ministries supported by the offering, significant numbers of persons have been <br> reclaimed for Jesus Christ from helplessness, homelessness, hopelessness, poverty, <br> racism, poor health and hunger. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">The offering supports projects such as transitional housing for persons as the church <br> assists these persons to pursue permanent housing, education, and other steps toward self <br> sufficiency; support for immigrant families; and advocacy for moderate and low income <br> community residents to seek government support for appropriate housing. More <br> information is available through the General Board of Global Ministries. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">The Youth Offender Rehabilitation programs include one-to-one mentoring for at-risk <br> and first time offender youth through providing spiritual direction, skills training and <br> social development. These programs offer services such as substance abuse treatment, <br> attitude/anger management, conflict resolution techniques, social skills, social <br> networking training, job readiness and training, and self-esteem. More information about <br> these is available through the General Board of Church and Society. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Ministries supported have often served as a compelling gateway toward Christian <br> ministry for lay and clergy leaders. <br> <i>2. One Great Hour of Sharing <br> </i><font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">This offering is the only local congregation source of donor undesignated funds for the <br> United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR). It provides the staff and <br> administrative support to enable The United Methodist Church to respond upon receipt of <br> a request from the bishops and Methodist Church Presidents throughout the world, rather <br> than waiting several weeks for the collection of special funds through special appeals or <br> donations. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">The strictly designated funds given to UMCOR are used in the field for disaster response, <br> relief and development projects around the world. These funds could not be totally given <br> for relief efforts without the One Great Hour of Sharing offering and other undesignated <br> gifts. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Since 1993, UMCOR not only funds local disaster response organizations, but also is <br> implementing large-scale responses such as post-war reconstruction in such places as <br> Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, and Iraq. <br> <i>3. World Communion Sunday <br> </i><font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">During the 2001-2004 quadrennium a portion of this offering designated for the Crusade <br> Scholarship Program has enabled 77 students from racial/ethnic communities in the <br> United States and 29 international students from around the world to prepare for <br> leadership through graduate study such as theology, medicine and health care, <br> evangelism, peace, justice, democracy, education, sustainable development, conflict <br> resolution, and business administration. <br> <i><br> </i><font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">On average each year more than 500 African American, Asian, Hispanic and Native <br> American students who are active in their local church receive scholarships through this <br> program. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">It enables the recruitment of ethnic minority persons into ordained ministry, scholarships <br> and in-service training grants. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Funds are designated to support and encourage ethnic lay, diaconal, licensed, <br> commissioned, and ordained ministers to grow personally, professionally, and spiritually <br> through the Ethnic In-Service Training program. <br> <i>4. United Methodist Student Day <br> </i><font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">During the past three years, an average of 550 students have been recipients of <br> scholarships funded from United Methodist Student Day, 475 students were awarded <br> United Methodist Scholarships by the college or university and 75 were student recipients <br> of the Conference Merit Scholarship. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">For the past three years an average of 1,100 students received loans. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Ten percent of the United Methodist Student Day offerings are rebated to the annual <br> conferences for the Conference Merit Scholarships to undergraduate students enrolled at <br> United Methodist colleges and universities. Of the remaining amount, 90% is allocated to <br> the 124 colleges, universities and seminaries for scholarship awards and 10% is used for <br> the United Methodist Student Loan Program. <br> <i>5. Peace with Justice Sunday <br> </i><font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">This Sunday helps United Methodists to examine how their faith relates to issues of war, <br> peace, and justice throughout the world. It provides education on subjects of peace with <br> justice. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Annual conferences retain half of the offering to support ministries within their annual <br> conference. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">The General Board of Church and Society dedicates approximately one-third of its Peace <br> with Justice grants to Central Conference peace making activities. <br> <i>6. Native American Ministries Sunday <br> </i><font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Native Americans attending United Methodist and other approved schools of theology <br> receive scholarships. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">This offering helps Native American ministries to become more self-sufficient. Native <br> people are encouraged to attend events that will strengthen their ministry. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Conference committees are helping raise awareness to Native American issues and needs. <br> Half of the offering is retained by the annual conference to develop and strengthen Native <br> American ministries within the annual conference <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">This Sunday observance has motivated many churches to greater involvement with <br> Native Americans through participation in the Advance Special Program or by sending <br> Volunteers in Mission teams to work with a Native American community. <br> Special Sundays without Churchwide Offerings <br> <i>1. Heritage Sunday <br> </i><font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Offers opportunities for reflection on our United Methodist heritage through our <br> collective memory as a church, celebrate where we&rsquo;ve been, and envision how it shapes <br> us today. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Many churches use the materials prepared for Heritage Sunday in confirmation classes. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">The General Commission on Archives and History prepares resource materials to assist <br> congregations in their observance of this day. When Heritage Sunday coincides with <br> other church observances, themes are chosen which support both celebrations. <br> <i>2. Laity Sunday <br> </i><font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Reminds laity of their call to ministry and their leadership in ministry. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Provides for a way for laity to recognize their role as worship leaders and speakers. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Some congregations pair Laity Sunday with other congregational observances such as <br> homecoming or stewardship emphases. <br> Sundays for Annual Conference Observation <br> <i>1. Christian Education Sunday <br> </i><font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Helps congregations to recognize the importance of the church&rsquo;s teaching and learning <br> ministry. It reinforces the concept that we are on a journey of life-long learning as <br> disciples of Jesus Christ. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Many congregations use this Sunday to dedicate teachers and leaders in the educational <br> ministry of the congregation. Others pair this with Rally Day and encourage all to <br> commit or recommit to learning opportunities. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Many use this Sunday as a time to present Bibles to children and remind the congregation <br> of the importance of Bible reading and study. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Funds raised from conference Christian Education offering support Christian Education <br> programs and leadership training. <br> <i>2. Golden Cross Sunday <br> </i><font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">This observance represents Christ&rsquo;s healing presence in a hurting world. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Conference offerings on Golden Cross Sunday are used to insure and extend the church&rsquo;s <br> efforts to increase health and wholeness for older persons, women, children and youth, <br> and persons with disabilities. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Many conferences use funds to support after-school care for children, scholarships for <br> students pursuing health-related careers, treatment for drug and alcohol abusers, and <br> advocacy programs for emerging critical health issues. Due to lack of adequate health <br> insurance, some conferences use funds for emergency services for people in need. <br> <i>3. Rural Life Sunday <br> </i><font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">This Sunday highlights the importance of &ldquo;the land&rdquo; in Christian and United <br> Methodist theology and heritage, including God&rsquo;s creation, our human dependence <br> upon the bounty of the earth, and our ecological stewardship. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">It acknowledges the rural heritage of United Methodism and the fact that 25,000 of <br> our congregations are in small towns and rural communities. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">It provides opportunity to address the global challenges in economic, education, <br> health care, and housing faced by people in rural areas. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">It affirms the interdependence of rural and urban congregations and communities. <br> <i>4. Disabilities Awareness Sunday <br> </i><font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">This Sunday provides opportunities for congregations to launch or extend their caring <br> and compassion for people with disabilities. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">As the United Methodist Church seeks to have &ldquo;open hearts, open minds, open <br> doors,&rdquo; we must move beyond opening the door to welcoming all of God&rsquo;s children <br> into our church by removing the physical and attitudinal barriers, whether real or <br> perceived. <br> <font FACE="TT16Eo00"><font FACE="Times New Roman">Accessibility includes providing ramps, lifts and elevators. It includes providing <br> assistive listening devices, interpreters, and real time captioning to people whom are <br> deaf or hard of hearing. It includes providing hymnals, bulletins, and Bibles in large <br> print or Braille for blind or those with low vision to see clearly. <br> <b>Recommendations <br> </b>1. To retain the six churchwide Special Sundays with offerings (i.e. Human Relations Day, One <br> Great Hour of Sharing, World Communion Sunday, United Methodist Student Day, Peace <br> with Justice Sunday, and Native American Ministries Sunday). <br> 2. To observe Heritage Sunday as a churchwide Special Sunday without offering, but to change <br> the observance date to Aldersgate Day (May 24) or the Sunday preceding that date. The day <br> provides an opportunity for reflection on heritage, celebration of where the Church has been, <br> how it understands itself as it shapes us today, and the meaning of Christian conferencing. <br> Heritage Sunday calls the Church to remember the past by committing itself to the continuing <br> call of God. <br> Changing the observance of Heritage Sunday from April 23 to May 24 would address the <br> concerns of the variability of Easter Sunday. The General Commission on Archives and <br> History, the GCOM and the GCFA acknowledged that more United Methodists are familiar <br> with Aldersgate Day than with the union of the Evangelical Brethren Church and the <br> Methodist Church and would be more likely to celebrate their heritage on Aldersgate Day <br> rather than on April 23<font SIZE="1">rd<font SIZE="3">. <br> 3. To continue Laity Sunday as a churchwide Special Sunday without offering. <br> 4. To delete Organ and Tissue Donor Sunday as a churchwide Special Sunday without offering. <br> When the General Conference designated this special Sunday, no agency was specifically <br> assigned the supervision or promotion of the observance. Thus, it has rarely been observed in <br> local churches. The GCOM and GCFA felt it would be better to have a more broadly focused <br> observance than on this singular issue, but was not prepared to make a recommendation to the <br> 2004 General Conference. <br> 5. To retain the four Sundays for annual conference observation (i.e. Christian Education <br> Sunday, Golden Cross Sunday, Rural Life Sunday, and Disability Awareness Sunday). <br> <i><br> </i>Signed _________________________________________ <br> Bishop Edward W.
