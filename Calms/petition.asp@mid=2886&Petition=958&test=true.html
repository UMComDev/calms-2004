<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >WHEREAS, in the 21st century the message of Christianity is an on-going struggle in understanding the great Christian affirmations and in confronting the thought processes which go beyond ourselves to understand mysteries of faith, science, culture, nature, our hope and destiny, and the Spirit of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our new century is characterized by growth, communication, education,&nbsp;&nbsp;pluralism,&nbsp;&nbsp;world economy as well as many threats, ideologies and forces&nbsp;&nbsp;within and beyond&nbsp;&nbsp;various world religions. <br> </font></b></b><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the United Methodist Church (UMC) has traditionally given high regard to the story&nbsp;&nbsp;of our faith in our primary frame of reference --the Holy Scripture-- including the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and the New Testament.&nbsp;&nbsp;(See Article V and VI of our Doctrinal Standards and General Rules of the Methodist Church and Article IV of the Confession of Faith of the Evangelical United Brethren Church). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, United Methodist people are called to struggle with our theological task which is both critical and constructive (par. 62, sect 4) including the guidelines and interaction of Scripture, Tradition, Experience and Reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;United Methodists, as a part of the Christian movement, find genuine Christianity as more than belief in the Bible (i.e." we are not saved by the Bible, but by a Savior of whom the Bible speaks"... page 20 of "Major United&nbsp;&nbsp;Methodist&nbsp;&nbsp;Beliefs").&nbsp;&nbsp;And the UMC believes in a balanced view of the Bible which is ageless in its stories and events, in its revelation and affirmation, and in its ministry to human needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this marvelous book is not to be worshipped, for the Bible is to be understood not with the mentality of a ferocious literalism but with an eye to be interpreted in the light of the Tradition, Experience, and the aid of Reason. ( page 10, "Major United Methodist Beliefs"). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, we understand the Bible as a library of many books with many wonderful stories of how God has interacted with humans, and it is the work of God and humans and the Church (its Councils and conferences) which cooperated in the making of the Biblical record. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, the various views on the authority and interpretation of the Biblical record are sometimes divisive and hot-issues causing schisms, inflaming charges of hearsay and mistrust and inciting counter-charges much of which depends on people's perception, worldviews, and cultural leanings.&nbsp;&nbsp;A large part of our problem has been that we have not been clear about what we mean by the word(s) or the Word of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even a recent General Conference failed to be declarative in helping to distinguish between the Bible as human words and what is implied by the notion of Divine word. It should&nbsp;&nbsp;be clear that all the words of the Biblical record are humans words whether those words were Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, or translations into Latin or English, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scripture is historically conditioned and clearly human words about humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the church, these words are more; and that is where the problems come in. Is there a Word of God in the midst of the human words?&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of meaning that we give that answer, or the answer which Jewish or Islamic people give to their sacred writings is the delicate and complex matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have a genuine literary appreciation of the records but we need to be far more careful in naively&nbsp;&nbsp;saying &ldquo;God is the author.&rdquo; (See the church school literature produced in the&nbsp;&nbsp;1960's and 70's as a series of self-instruction children's literature by Paul B. and Mary Carolyn Maves which includes much insight into how we got our Bible, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, other helps are the text "Who Wrote the Bible," by Richard Elliott Friedman and the United Methodist Women's&nbsp;&nbsp;two-part series,"The Bible : The Book that Bridges the Millennia," (and the website associated with these books) by Maxine Clark Beach.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Bible doesn't have the same authority in all its parts: i.e. we don't follow closely or observe the ceremonies and sacrifices of the Hebrew Bible or keep the Sabbath as the 7th day, nor observe circumcision, and we don't take literally St. Paul's view about women in I Cor. 14: 31-35 where women are to keep their heads covered and not speech&nbsp;&nbsp;in church.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although sadly there are some church sects or groups who would seek to mandate this as a dogmatic requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, taking the Bible literally and giving a narrow interpretation to it has often been a principle which has caused Christians horrendous problems as does the similar attitude toward sacred scripture in other world religions--as with the Orthodox Jew and the Wahhabis in the Islamic faith (the other two Abrahamic faiths).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, it is important that we as a faith community and a denomination which has promoted ecumenicity and dialogue keep these following principles: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that God is our authority. God and God alone has the right to command and give guidance through the Holy Spirit to our faith and life, and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that the supreme revelation of God for the Christian is in the Christ--the Christ who we know not only by the words of the Biblical record but also as we have to struggle with early writers and their various words, concepts, symbols, metaphors, etc. as they tried to convey what God was doing in the life&nbsp;&nbsp;of the early church. Furthermore, we recognize Christ as&nbsp;&nbsp;the Word.&nbsp;&nbsp;To worship the words is Bibliolatry and that diminishes the vitality of our efforts to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;the God head or minister&nbsp;&nbsp;effectively. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) as a church relating to the world of genetics, atoms, computers, Hubble telescopes and changing world views, we have to distinguish between what is central and what is incidental, what is essential and what is not, what are our central convictions of faith and what are our interpretations or explanation of&nbsp;&nbsp;them.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Bible uses the language of&nbsp;&nbsp;symbols, word-pictures, metaphors and parables; and to treat this wonderful book as literal haphazardly is to help to destroy the very&nbsp;&nbsp;faith we attempt to convey.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the UMC has no lock-hold on being much different from our society which is largely&nbsp;&nbsp;Biblically illiterate; and at the same time it is paramount that we ask the hard and exciting questions and not be faint-of-heart in being Biblical scholars or theologians who research the ins and outs, the ups and downs of the political and religious forces which confronted those who compiled the Biblical record and confront us as well who deal with this most holy document. It is important that we not give mere allegiance to creeds, dogmas, doctrine, or&nbsp;&nbsp;political entities, and make them idols, which will then turnoff future generations who will ask honest questions about our out -dated views.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the challenge is to always&nbsp;&nbsp;be on the cutting-edge and not locked ourselves into a narrow understanding of certain proof -texts supporting our pet-dogmas or prejudices at a particular time. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the UMC has over 250 resolutions in its Book of Resolutions compiled by recent General Conferences which deal with a multitude of world problems as well as social issues of all kinds, and the UMC people would seek to be faithful in our actions in the midst of global challenges .&nbsp;&nbsp;We would seek to be faithful to each other in our theological task by being honest about the value as well as the limitations of our scripture, our doctrines, our creeds, our simple solutions, and even our use of words and attitudes which can destroy our own denomination. The tendency of Christian fundamentalist (as well as fundamentalists in other faiths groups) to accept the literal, factual truth of everything contained in the Biblical record (or at least what is selectively decided by that group) leads to much the same problems as when the Islamic fundamentalist&nbsp;&nbsp;(Wahhabi Islam) views the Qur'an (Koran) in a literal way and then proceeds to preach extremism, hate, and violence against others&nbsp;&nbsp;including other Muslims like Shiite and moderate Sunnis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the written and spoken language of faith people is such that we are constantly dealing with what is concrete and historical and what is interpretative, constructive, based on previous narratives,&nbsp;&nbsp;and poetical, analogous, metaphorical, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;And some humans statements, spoken or written, are often given as if they were meant to be factual reality; but they are often limited in conveying&nbsp;&nbsp;what is real theologically.&nbsp;&nbsp;(See The Annunciation of the Birth of Jesus, chapter 8, of "The Bible, Now I Get It!" and entertaining look&nbsp;&nbsp;at the Bible for people who think they know it already, by Gerhard Lohfink) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, those who take this narrow view (literalist) of the scriptures are more often or not more legalistic, reject scientific analysis, are hostile toward higher criticism, and are anti-intellectual and&nbsp;&nbsp;thereby have less respect for the dialectical tradition. Over time it is clear to United Methodist that we are strengthen by the diversity of our people.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are strengthen when we question our tradition and our theological points of view.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly what Jesus did as he confronted the Pharisees, Scribes, Herodians, etc. with ideas and new viewpoints of long established and synagogue-held thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;And as Christians and United Methodists we get into dilemmas when we claim certainty and give pat-answers to the mystery of God&nbsp;&nbsp;making images of God out of our&nbsp;&nbsp;words and calling our words creeds or articles of faith. That straight- jacketing of ideas is morally troublesome for modern, scientifically trained minds.&nbsp;&nbsp;A three story universe, with a flat earth and a heaven arching above with a hell lying below is a cosmology difficult for many modern people unless they see this as part of the pre-Copernium-Galileo world view.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the same is true with the early church&rsquo;s confidence in the imminent return of the Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these ideas need to be seen in a new light with new categories of thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, the church&rsquo;s position toward Galileo and his scientific ideas&nbsp;&nbsp;was a contemptuous mistake; and it was not until 1991 (450 years later) when Pope John Paul II&nbsp;&nbsp;apologized for that church-driven mistake and blindness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike our brothers and sisters in the second largest protestant denomination, the UMC needs to not lock itself into a tradition that monitors seminaries, churches or personnel with a test to see whether these entities meet prescribed legalistic beliefs about&nbsp;&nbsp;how they interpret or believe the Bible. That mentality works against the very freedom which is so critical in the freedom which the Christ gives us as followers. The 1990 book entitled&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death or Dialogue" makes the point that we must move from the age of monologue to the age of dialogue, and when dialogue functions fully and is not distorted its results are healthy and fulfilling to all involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;In efforts to be in dialogue, it will most surely involve confrontation but also understanding and cooperation. That is what the church and what the UMC must be promoting if the religion of Islam, Judaism, and other world religions would be open to the change and transformation in which the Holy Spirit would give guidance (see "Death or Dialogue? From the Age of Monologue to the Age of Dialogue," 1990). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Therefore</i><font FACE="Times New Roman">, while the UMC finds guidance and meaning in the primary source, the Biblical Record, and it also takes seriously the theological task of full inquiry into the struggle regarding the interpretation&nbsp;&nbsp;and authority of scripture, the UMC proclaims the need to guard against the efforts of some who are tempted to make and allow the interpretation of scripture as ridged doctrine, most specifically the literalist approach and that&nbsp;&nbsp;effort to impose that view on others and the larger church. ( &ldquo;...in vain do they worship me, teaching human precepts as doctrine.&nbsp;&nbsp;You abandon the commandments of God , and hold on to human traditions&rdquo; - NSRV Mark 7: 7-8).&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever spectrum of interpretation which would lock-us into&nbsp;&nbsp;narrow, limited view and exclude openness and dialogue&nbsp;&nbsp;about our&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;good book&rdquo; can easily cause our denomination to belittle the principles of toleration and pluralism and limit the church to pre-scientific thought. The criteria for UMC people is not to make an idol out of our gift of the biblical record and its understanding but to say as our historical brother said years ago, &ldquo; If your heart is as my heart , give me your hand.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let us not write creeds or set rules or develop tests of orthodoxy to determine who is or isn&rsquo;t a true believer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be in dialogue about our gifts and&nbsp;&nbsp;the wonders of our wonderful creature-hood.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" ></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" ><br> </font><font SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman" ><br> <font SIZE="2"><br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
