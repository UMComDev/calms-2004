<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >HUMAN RIGHTS IN SAUDI ARABIA <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b>Saudi Arabia is a monarchy governed according to Islamic law. The Koran is the constitution of the country. There are no elections, and political parties are illegal. The practice of any religion other than Islam is illegal. The media is tightly controlled by the government. Political and religious dissidents are harassed, arrested, detained, and tortured, according to international human rights groups such as Amnesty International. Amputations and beheadings are conducted on regime opponents. The rights of women are sharply curtailed. Adulturers and homosexuals can be sentenced to death. Children can be flogged for legal infractions. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>THE ISSUES <br> </b><br> <b>Freedom of Speech - </b>Criticism of the royal family, of Islam, and of the government are prohibited. The government owns all broadcast media, restricts the print media, censors foreign media, and restricts the activity of foreign journalists. Internet access is filtered by the government to block anti-government or anti-Islamic information. Trade unions and strikes are prohibited. Foreign laborers are not protected by labor law. Public demonstrations are illegal. Government permission is needed to form professional associations. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Free Elections - </b>There are no elections in Saudi Arabia. The king is chosen by leading members of the royal family with subsequent approval from Islamic leaders. The king is obliged to rule with consensus from the leaders of the royal family and Islamic leaders. The king also appoints a Council of Ministers, which proposes legislation that requires a royal decree. Laws are administered by religious courts whose judges the king appoints. The king is the highest court of appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Political Prisoners - </b>Political prisoners in Saudi Arabia number in the hundreds and may number in the thousands. Floggings, bodily mutilations, and beheadings are used against criminal and political offenders of all ages. Torture, although supposedly illegal, is common within the Saudi legal system. Trials are held in secret.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Religious Freedom&nbsp;&nbsp;- </b>There is no legal permission for any religious group publicly to practice its faith other than the Wahhabi interpretation of Sunni Islam. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs pays the salaries of Muslim clerics and for the construction and upkeep of most mosques. Shiite Muslims, who comprise up to ten percent of the population, face numerous restrictions on their public practice and encounter employment discrimination. Shiite clergy have been arrested. There are 7 million foreigners living in Saudi Arabia, and as many as 1 million of them may be Roman Catholic. Other Christian churches are represented among the foreign population. They can practice their faith only in private. Evangelism is illegal. Converts from Islam can be executed. Non-Muslim worshipers can risk arrest, imprisonment, lashing, deportation, and torture.&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribution of non-Muslim materials, like Bibles, is illegal. Noncitizens must carry papers identifying their religion. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Rights of Women - </b>Unmarried women are legally considered the wards of their fathers. Married women are considered wards of their husbands. A widowed woman is the ward of her sons. Women may not get an identity card, get exit visas, or get into hospitals without male permission. Women are segregated from men in all areas of public life. Women may not drive or travel without a male relative. Women in public must wear black clothing that covers their body and most of their face. Religious police harass women who defy these laws. Women who commit adultery are vulnerable to being stoned to death. The legal testimony of women has less legal value than a man&rsquo;s. Laws about marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance discriminate against women. Female students may not study engineering, law, or journalism. Women comprise five percent of the Saudi workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>OUR RESPONSE <br> </b><br> The United Methodist Church calls for the creation of and protection of basic human rights and democratic liberties in Saudi Arabia. We pray for all Saudi Arabians, especially for the church in Saudi Arabia. In particular, we pray for full religious freedom, a free press, free elections, equal rule of all for all people, the abolition of torture, and the end to floggings, body amputations, and other grisly punishments. We shall be an advocate for human rights and democratic reforms within Saudi Arabia in our interactions with the U.S. government and other governments, with ecumenical organizations, and directly with the Saudi government, when possible. We stand in solidarity with all persecuted persons in Saudi Arabia. <font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
