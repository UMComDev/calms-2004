<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >HUMAN RIGHTS IN SYRIA <br> </b><br> Syria is a one-party dictatorship. Under its constitution, the president, who must be Muslim, is nominated by the ruling Arab Socialist Baath party. All members of the People&rsquo;s Assembly are members of the ruling party or of several smaller parties that are tightly controlled by the government. According to international human rights groups such as Amnesty International, security agencies and police have virtually unlimited power to arrest, detain, and torture. The government owns or tightly restricts all media. Islamic practices govern some discriminatory practices toward women. The economy is tightly controlled by the ruling party and its socialist policies. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>THE ISSUES <br> </b><br> <b>Freedom of Speech - </b>Any speech or activity that opposes &ldquo;the goals of the revolution&rdquo; of the ruling party is prohibited. The government owns all broadcast media. All privately owned print media must submit their publications to government censors for approval. The government blocks access to a wide range of Web sites. Journalists who have criticized the government have been arrested. Only the government and ruling party may organize demonstrations. All organizations must register with the government. Human rights activists, such as the Syrian Human Rights Association, have been arrested. All unions must belong to the General Federation of Trade Unions, which is controlled by the government.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Free Elections</b> - The Baath party is the only significant political party, and it decides who will fill all political offices. The selection of presidents requires referendum, but the current president, Bashar Assad, and his late father, the previous president, were always approved by more than 99 percent of voters, thanks to government manipulation. Smaller political parties are required to join with the Baath party in a National Progressive Front that is controlled by the Baath party. The People&rsquo;s Assembly, which is elected every four years in controlled elections, has no independent power and defers to the president. The number of independent candidates who sit in the Assembly is closely controlled. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Political Prisoners</b> - The Emergency Law allows arbitrary arrests and incommunicado, indefinite detention by security services without charge. There may be as many as 800 political prisoners, many of whom have never been tried. Security services, which are not accountable to courts, routinely torture inmates to extract confessions and detain members of their families. The government conducts widespread surveillance of potential and real opponents. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Religious Freedom</b> - Syria&rsquo;s constitution provides for the freedom of religion.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the government closely monitors mosques and appoints the Muslim clergy. Islamic jurisprudence is required to be the main source of legislation. Religious courts handle questions of personal and family law, according to Islamic dictates. All religious groups must register with the government. Christians comprise about ten percent of the population. The Greek Orthodox is the largest church. Evangelism is not illegal but is discouraged by the government. Jews are prohibited from holding government positions and are the only religious group whose identity cards describe their religion. Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses are banned from public worship.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Women&rsquo;s Rights</b> - Women have gained government positions and access to education. But many laws continue to discriminate against them. Husbands can prevent wives from leaving the country. In accordance with Islamic law, women do not have equal rights in marriage, divorce, and inheritance. Sentences against perpetrators of&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;honor killings&rdquo; of female relatives who have committed alleged sexual infidelities can be light, according to Syrian law. Polygamy is legal but not often practiced. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>OUR RESPONSE <br> </b><br> The United Methodist Church calls for the creation and protection of basic human rights and the expansion of democratic liberties in Syria. We pray for all Syrians, especially for the church in Syria. In particular, we pray for full religious freedom, a free press, free elections, equal rule of all for all people, and the abolition of torture. We shall be an advocate for human rights and democratic reforms within Syria and in our interactions with the U.S. government and other governments, with ecumenical organizations, and directly with the Syrian government, when possible. We stand in solidarity with human rights advocates in Syria.<font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
