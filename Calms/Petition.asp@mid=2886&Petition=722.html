</font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Putting Children and Their Families First <br> </font></b></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> &ldquo;We believe the family to be the basic human community through which persons are nurtured and sustained in mutual love, responsibility, respect and fidelity.&rdquo; Children are &ldquo;acknowledged to be full human beings in their own right, but beings to whom adults and society in general have special obligations. ...All children have the right to quality education. ...Moreover, children have the rights to food, shelter, clothing, health care, and emotional well-being as do adults, and these rights we affirm as theirs regardless of actions or inactions of their parents or guardians. In particular, children must be protected from economic, physical and sexual exploitation and abuse.&rdquo; (From Social Principles of The United Methodist Church in <i>The Book of Discipline</i>.) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >The Problem <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> Growing up whole and healthy is increasingly difficult for children. They face weakening support systems throughout society, from home to school to church, at the very time they are struggling with unprecedented stresses. They are forced to grow up too quickly, to make significant life choices at a younger and younger age. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The percentage of children in poverty is the most widely used indicator of child well-being. Growth in the ranks of poor children in the United States over the past few decades has not been due to an increase in the number of welfare-dependent families; rather, it is because the ranks of the working poor have been growing. For example, between 1976 and 2000, the number of children living in economically poor families who were totally dependent on welfare fell from 2.8 million to 1.1 million. At the same time, the number of children living in economically poor families who had income from jobs, but no financial public assistance, increased from 4.4 million to 6.9 million. A major reason for these discrepancies was a significant change in the way the U.S. government provides public assistance to low- and no-income families. Despite the enormous wealth in the United States, the child poverty rate is among the highest in the developed world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> (from &ldquo;KIDS COUNT DATA BOOK 2002&rdquo;) <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Globally, children are increasingly at risk from the effects of poverty. UNICEF reported, in its 2002 Annual Report, that <font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif">"<font FACE="Times New Roman">a child born today has a one-in-four chance of being born into poverty-a life of poor health, missed education and increased violence, insecurity and discrimination.&rdquo; Poverty inflicts irreparable damage on young bodies and minds. Nearly 11 million children under the age of five die each year from common illnesses and malnutrition associated with poverty. Poverty undermines the health, abilities and potential of millions more children. </b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">Public Policy Implications <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >In light of the critical nature of the problems described above, The United Methodist Church should press for public polices that: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 1. guarantee basic income for all families regardless of structure; <br> 2. provide basic support services for families in economic crisis, including food and nutrition programs, crisis respite care, and home care services; <br> 3. mandate full and complete access to health and medical care, including health maintenance, prenatal and well-baby services, and mental health services for all family members, including a highly under-served group: young children and teens; <br> 4. assure safe and affordable housing for families without regard to number and ages of children; and <br> 5. safeguard protective services for children at risk of abuse. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Too often we engage in public policy debate, make new laws and cut budgets and programs without putting the highest priority on how any change or policy will affect children and their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> We call upon United Methodists to ask the following questions of any pending legislation, any budget cut, any new policy: <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are children&rsquo;s needs and well-being considered first and foremost in evaluating health and welfare, or any other national, state, or local policy? <br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will this program or policy make fewer children poor or increase the likelihood of children growing up healthy, educated, and prepared to work and contribute to the future productivity of the economy? <br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will this program or policy make families more self-sufficient, enabling parents to work by providing them with jobs and the tools of work (education and training, child care, health care, child support enforcement, before- and after-school care)? <br> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will this program or policy support families in providing care, nurture, safety, and stability to children? <br> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will this program or policy help the many who have little rather than the few who have much? <br> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will this program or policy help families stay together and care for children? <br> 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this program or policy refrain from punishing children for the actions or inactions of their parents or guardians? <br> 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will this program or policy actually save money in the long run, rather than gain a short-sighted savings that leaves the next generation to pay the price? <br> 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this program or policy as fair to children as to adults, to women as to men, and to poor as to affluent families? <br> 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will this program or policy provide young people with opportunities for a meaningful future, while celebrating the contributions they make in the present? <br> 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will this program develop in children a sense of responsibility for themselves and their communities? <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Legislators and other public leaders should be held accountable to citizens and voters for their answers to these questions and for the results of their actions. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Church Program and Policy Implications <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Churches must strengthen and expand their ministry and advocacy efforts on behalf of children and their families. A coordinated ministry that serves families with children in the congregations and in the larger community, that works hand-in-hand with human service providers and ecumenical colleagues, and that addresses the public policy concerns listed above is needed in every church and community. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The church has traditionally emphasized the integrity of the institutions of marriage and family and the responsibilities of parenthood. While these emphases should be maintained, a holistic ministry with families must, of necessity, be based on the broadest possible definition of family so that the great variety of structures and configurations will be included. Grandparents often function as parents, and many families are headed by single parents or &ldquo;blended&rdquo; through divorce and re-marriage. Adoption, fostering, and extended family structures are among those that need the church&rsquo;s ministry. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Churches need to understand that all the problems described here happen to individuals and families inside the congregation as well as in the community. It is critically important that each congregation deal openly with the needs of its members and its community and begin developing appropriate ministry responses for children and their families. Support groups, hotlines, shelters, parenting classes, treatment programs. home care services, nutrition and feeding programs, and after-school tutoring and mentoring programs are especially needed in many communities; they are programs that churches are often well-suited to sponsor or support. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> A network of child-serving institution and agencies, from community centers to residences for at-risk children and youth, exists across the church. Many are local expressions of national or&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> international mission, and others are related to annual conferences. These agencies meet critical needs and urgently require the financial, volunteer, and prayer support of congregations. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The Council of Bishops, in its 2001 document on the Initiative on Children and Poverty, said that:</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; <b><font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif">"<font FACE="Times New Roman">In a world constituted by division and competition, in which the gap between the rich and the poor widens like a yawning chasm and human life is reduced to a marketable commodity, while the impoverished majority of the earth becomes invisible to the prosperous few, it is the church that is called to be the visible and tangible presence of a community built upon grace.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> We Call upon The United Methodist Church to: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generate a plan in every local church for assessing ministry with children (in the congregation and in the community) and implementing a vision for ministry with children and their families that takes seriously the facts and perspectives presented above. This plan is to be overseen by the official decision-making body of every local church. The manual <i>Putting Children and Their Families First: A Planning Handbook for Congregations</i>* can guide the process. <br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the Bishops&rsquo; Initiative on Children and Poverty manual Community with Children and the Poor: A Guide for Congregational Study* in every local church. <br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celebrate the Children&rsquo;s Sabbath in every local church each October. Utilize the resource manual* developed annually by the Children&rsquo;s Defense Fund. <br> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase awareness of the needs of children and their families by challenging the church&rsquo;s leaders (including bishops, general agency staff, director of connectional ministries, superintendents as well as local church clergy and lay leaders) to spend the equivalent of one full day each year as a volunteer at a local outreach ministry that serves children, such as a community center, child care center, tutoring or parenting program, or shelter for homeless families. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue and strengthen a task force formed of persons from general church agencies who work on issues of child and family advocacy, in order to coordinate work. The task force will be convened annually by the Office of Children&rsquo;s Ministries of the General Board of Discipleship. <br> <i><br> *Order from Service Center (1-800-305-9857)</b></i><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
