<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Replace Chapter 5 � XIV, �� 2001-2008 and � XV �� 2101-2109 with the following proposed new paragraphs:<b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <font FACE="Times New Roman">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></i></u>
There shall be a General Commission on Justice for Women, Minorities and Persecuted Christians. This General Commission shall be the successor to both the General Commission on Religion and Race and to the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women. It shall embrace the responsibilities, general policies and practices, and functions of these predecessor commissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  2. Purpose <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This commission shall function as an advocate with and for women, racial and ethnic minorities, and persecuted Christians.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its work shall be rooted in the liberating gospel of Jesus Christ and thereby recognize that every person is important and loved by God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This commission shall be committed to racial, ethnic, and gender inclusiveness within our denomination. It shall provide assistance to United Methodists around the globe so that there are equal opportunities for service, representation, and voice on every level of the Church&rsquo;s life and ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This commission shall inform, recruit, lobby, and otherwise creatively advocate for a redress of inequities, past and present, within the important institutions and structures of our secular world. It shall be especially sensitive and vigorous in those situations where Christians are in danger of losing life, family, freedom and property.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 3. Responsibilities <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This commission shall have the power to hold hearings to review and investigate written allegations of violations of church policy on gender, racial and ethnic inclusiveness provided that such allegations have not been satisfactorily resolved in the local church, district, annual conference, general agency or other institution of the church. Any such hearing shall be conciliatory and reconciling. Any findings shall be summarized and communicated in a reconciling spirit to the participating parties. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This commission shall administer the Minority Group Self-Determination Fund, and any other such Fund entrusted to it, according to the guidelines and policies that it shall establish, relying upon close consultation with the General Council on Finance and Administration in matters of fund administration and accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This commission shall provide resources for local congregations, districts, annual conferences, jurisdictions and central conferences. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This commission shall have the power to do research within the denomination, gathering information and publishing its evaluations and findings. Such publishing shall include progress reports on our church&rsquo;s work in eradicating sexism and racism. This commission shall apply its researched conclusions as it cooperates with the General Council of Finance and Administration in allocating funds under � 811.1. Its research on women&rsquo;s issues shall be coordinated with the Women&rsquo;s Division of the General Board of Global Ministries. <br> 4. Funding and staffing <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Funding shall be provided in the budgets adopted by the General Conference and administered through the General Council of Finance and Administration. In its initial quadrennium, the funds available to this commission shall, as a minimum, be equal to the funding of both of its predecessor commissions in the prior quadrennium. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >This commission shall nominate its general secretary for election according to the procedures in the Book of Discipline. Preferably, the general secretary shall be an African leader, personally acquainted with the persecution of Christians. <br> This commission shall maintain staff in Africa in a primary effort to fulfil its duties regarding advocacy for and with persecuted Christians. It shall also maintain staff in Washington, DC, and near United Nations and media centers as spokespersons for persecuted Christians. It shall coordinate with the General Board of Church and Society and the General Board of Global Missions, in providing for its staff. It shall consult with the Women&rsquo;s Division of the General Board of Global ministries when selecting staff related to women&rsquo;s issues. <br>  5.

It is recommended that those elected include women, minority racial and ethnic groups, and persecuted Christians. <br> <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></i></u>Additional members</i>-Up to ten additional members may be elected by the board, with consideration given to representation of persecuted Christians, gender, minority racial and ethnic groups not otherwise elected, and to special knowledge or background in lobbying, public information and public relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></i></u>Young Adult</i>-At least one person who is a young adult at the time of election shall be elected each quadrennium. <br> <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></i></u>Vacancies</i>-Vacancies shall be filled by the procedures defined in �712 of the General Provisions. <br> <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></i></u>Officers</i>-This commission shall elect from among its members a president, vice-president, and secretary and such other officers, as it deems necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></i></u>Executive Committee</i>-The officers and others so elected, up to a total of seven members, may constitute an executive committee if the board approves.
