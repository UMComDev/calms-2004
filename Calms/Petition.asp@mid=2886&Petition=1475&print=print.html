<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><u><b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >CONCORDAT <br> </u></b>Between <br> The United Methodist Church (UMC) <br> And <br> The Methodist Church of Puerto Rico (MCPR) <br> </font></u></u></b></b></CENTER><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" ><u><b>BACKGROUND <br> </b><br> </u>The relationship between the UMC and the MCPR is unique as established by the 1992 General Conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1972, the General Conference, upon petition of the Puerto Rico Annual Conference to become affiliated autonomous, passed as Enabling Act authorizing a transition to that status.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Decision No. 470, the Judicial Council upheld the legality of the realignment, recognizing that implementing work would be done afterwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years later, basic implementation was achieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1992, the General Conference passed legislation (petition 671) ratifying steps which had been taken to that point and laying down a set of interim guidelines or "foundations" which would be followed in the further development of the transitional relationship between the two churches through the year 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2000 General Conference extended the interim agreement through 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the specified features were such things as authorization of special relationships with general agencies, participation by delegates in General Conference, eligibility for scholarships, resource sharing, and seating of the Resident Bishop of the MCPR in the Council of Bishops (with voice, not vote).&nbsp;&nbsp;In its decision No.692, the Judicial Council approved the latter provision as consistent with the Constitution and <u>Book of Discipline. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </u>Thus, given the 104 years relationship between the two churches and the successful completion of the interim agreement at the end of 2004, the two churches for the sake of mission and to enhance mutual collaboration do hereby renew the special provisions drafted in 1992 in the form of a <i>Concordat Agreement</i>, following the provisions of paragraphs 12.2 and 552 of <i>The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church (2000). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;THEOLOGICAL MUTUALITY</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b>The MCPR and UMC acknowledge the centrality of the sovereignty of Jesus Christ as basic to all relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our links with the apostolic faith through Scripture, tradition, experience, and reason lead us now solemnly to affirm to each other that "all who are baptized into Christ are members of Christ's ministry through the people of the one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit" (COCO Digest, 1974, page 335, <i>Official Record, XIL </i>1974). <br> (a) We therefore recognize our respective baptisms as one baptism and mutually recognize that the members of the MCPR and of the UMC are members of one body of Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;Letters of membership shall be used when moving from one church to the other. <br> (b) We therefore recognize each other as authentic expressions of the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church of Jesus Christ, witnessing everywhere to God's present and coming Reign and its shalom for all humankind. <br> (c) We therefore recognize the ordained ministries of our churches and pledge to honor those ministries by the exchange or transfer of ordained ministers between properly constituted bodies where the approval and consent of the appropriate authorities involved is given.&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize further that paragraphs 338.2b and 547.2 of <i>The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church (2000) </i>applies to such exchanges and transfers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The assumption of pastoral care of members visiting or residing in one another's context is another instance of this aspect of this <i>Concordat Agreement.</i><br> (d) We are committed to participation in full Eucharistic celebration one with another. <br> (e) We are committed to seeking new and innovative approaches to partnership, visitations and programs. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>II. SPECIFIC PROVISIONS</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b>(a) Each church shall select two delegates (one lay, one clergy) to be seated in each other's General Conference, with all rights and privileges (including the right of voice and vote). <br> (b) Each church will make provisions for full hospitality, including room and board, for the delegates of the other concordat church, except that travel and other expenses will be the responsibility of the visiting church. <br> (c) The Bishop pf the Methodist Church of Puerto Rico will participate, at its own expense, in the meetings of the Council of Bishops of The United Methodist Church with voice but no vote. <br> (d) The Methodist Church of Puerto Rico will have one liaison representative, at its own expense, to each of the general program agencies of The United Methodist Church. <br> (e) The Methodist Church of Puerto Rico will continue to support Hispanic ministries in The United Methodist Church through participation in the National Plan for Hispanic/Latino Ministries. <br> (f) The Methodist Church of Puerto Rico will continue to share pastoral, lay and volunteer leadership with The United Methodist Church for service in Hispanic and other ministries, and missionaries in Latin America/Caribbean and other parts of the world. <br> (g) Given the role fully trained and qualified pastors of the Methodist Church of Puerto Rico play in serving Hispanic Congregations in the US and as Missionaries in other countries as well as filling invaluable general and conference staff roles for The United Methodist Church, members and churches of the Methodist Church of Puerto Rico will remain eligible for scholarships and other grants and proposals offered by the general agencies of The United Methodist Church. <br> (h) Partnership in Mission between the Methodist Church of Puerto Rico and The United Methodist Church will be carried out through the General Board of Global Ministries of The United Methodist Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> (i) Specific agreements for collaboration between the general agencies of The United Methodist Church and the Methodist Church of Puerto Rico will be honored. <br> (j) Specific provisions of this <i>Concordat Agreement </i>may be revised as may become necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Conference of both Churches shall approve any such revisions, which shall not become effective until so approved. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>III. Hope&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b></i> This <i>Concordat Agreement </i>recognizes what has been in effect between these churches, especially in areas of mutual mission and ministry, with profound gratitude to God for those in both churches who have brought us to this wondrous moment. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> We enter this <i>Concordat </i>believing that the God revealed in Jesus Christ has far more in store for our churches, in matters of mutual faithfulness to the Gospel, that we can see or imagine at this important juncture.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we enter this <i>Concordat </i>with mutual trust, gratitude and hopeful expectation in the name of Jesus Christ. <br> <font FACE="Tahoma">
