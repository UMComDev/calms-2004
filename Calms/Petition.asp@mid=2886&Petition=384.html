<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Human Rights in Cuba <br> </b><br> </font></b></b></CENTER><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Cuba has suffered under a one-party dictatorship led by one man for over 40 years. There is no legal opposition party. There are no legal independent media. Religious activity is legal only if it does not directly challenge the power of the Communist party. Private property is limited, and the government controls virtually every aspect of the economy. Labor unions exist only as appendages of the government and the Communist party. According to human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International, thousands are imprisoned because of their opposition to the dictatorship. Torture of prisoners is not uncommon. Travel, especially the ability to leave the country, is heavily restricted by the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> THE ISSUES: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Freedom of Speech</b> -&nbsp;&nbsp;Cuban law limits freedom of expression, association and assembly. Cubans can be imprisoned for three years or more if they criticize the Communist party or its chief, Fidel Castro. They who disagree with the government can be &ldquo;subjected to short term detentions, interrogations, summonses, official warnings, threats, intimidation, eviction, loss of employment, restrictions on travel, house searches, house arrests, telephone bugging and physical and verbal acts of aggression carried out by government supporters,&rdquo; according to Amnesty International.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Journalists often have been imprisoned for direct or even implied criticisms of the Cuban government. They are charged with offenses of &ldquo;disrespect,&rdquo; &ldquo;public disorder,&rdquo; &ldquo;revealing state security secrets,&rdquo; &ldquo;enemy propaganda,&rdquo; &ldquo;insult to the symbols of the homeland,&rdquo; &ldquo;spreading false news against international peace,&rdquo; and &ldquo;dangerousness.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> One journalist, after her release after serving a ten-month sentence, reported that the prison conditions were &ldquo;subhuman in all senses.&rdquo; The water given to the prisoners was contaminated with sewage. And she said most prisoners are suffering from dermatitis, diarrhea, and/or vaginal infections. Other former prisoners report long periods of confinement, no toilets or running water, no medical treatment, insufficient food, and beatings by guards. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Free Elections</b> - Cuba&rsquo;s constitution recognizes only the Communist party as the ruling authority. Opposition parties are illegal. The party controls all governmental and judicial positions. Only rarely do non-party members serve in the National Assembly. Party membership is still required for decent jobs, serviceable housing, and real access to all social services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Independent human rights advocacy groups exist in Cuba but are illegal. The Assembly to Promote Civil Society arose in 2002, founded by former political prisoner Marta Betriz Roque Cabello. The All Together Movement sponsored a petition calling for a referendum on fundamental freedoms, which gathered over 11,000 signatures and was presented to the National Assembly. The Christian Liberation Movement, headed by Oswaldo Paya Sardinas, also helped organize this petition. The Cuban Committee for Human Rights, the Lawton Human Rights Foundation, the National Council for Civil Rights in Cuba, the Cuban Youth Movement for Democracy and the Cuban Commission of Human Rights, the Third Millennium Forum, the 13 July Opposition Movement, and the National Reconciliation are also active, as is Linea Sur Press, an opposition press agency. Leaders of these groups have all been imprisoned for their activities critical of the Cuban government. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The government rejected this call for protection of human rights. Instead, the government organized a petition ostensibly signed by 99 percent of all Cubans calling for a reaffirmation of communism. The National Assembly unanimously approved a constitutional amendment declaring that socialism in Cuba is irrevocable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> <b> Political Prisoners</b> -&nbsp;&nbsp; At least several hundred opponents of the Cuban government continue to be imprisoned. They include journalists, political dissidents, religious leaders, and other activists. Persons have been imprisoned for criticizing Fidel Castro, writing unauthorized leaflets, performing acts of symbolic protest against the government, criticism of the Cuban police, opposing participation in Cuban elections, openly praying for political prisoners, organizing unauthorized religious processions, and organizing unauthorized political demonstrations. There is a special prison for female political prisoners called the Women&rsquo;s Re-education Center in Havana. The Manto Negro prison is another facility with political prisoners. The Cuban Technical Investigations Department often conducts interrogations of political detainees. Cuba does not allow the International Red Cross or other humanitarian groups to have access to its prisons. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Religious Freedom</b> - Although Cuba&rsquo;s constitution grants religious freedom, there are in fact severe restrictions on religious practice. The government is now officially secular rather than atheist. But the government often is suspicious of religion. Churches are required to be registered with the government and are monitored closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;Security agents frequently spy on worshipers.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The government insists that churches are permitted to build in Cuba. But all church creation and construction requires governmental permission, which is often difficult to obtain. Some churches have been subjected to threats with fines, confiscation of belongings, and repeatedly forced to close their doors.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Religious organizations may not legally publish their own materials. They are also denied regular access to the media, are restricted in the number of clergy they can train, and are restricted in their creation of hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions. No religious schools are allowed. All education for children is supposed to be government run and secular. In past years, students who expressed religious inclinations were ostracized and formally disciplined. In some cases, religious students were prohibited from continuing their education in a school of higher learning, such as a college or university.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> House churches are increasingly common in Cuba, which are legal only if part of a government-recognized denomination. The government is less restrictive towards denominations that belong to the Cuban Council of Churches. Religious groups must get government approval before meeting outside of religious buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> <b> <font SIZE="3">OUR RESPONSE <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b><font SIZE="3">The United Methodist Church calls for protection of basic human rights and the creation of&nbsp;&nbsp;democratic liberties in Cuba. We pray for all Cubans, especially for the church in Cuba. In particular, we pray for full religious freedom, a free press, free elections, equal rule of all for all people, and the abolition of torture.&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall be an advocate for human rights and democratic reforms within Cuba in our interactions with the U.S. government and other governments, with ecumenical organizations, and directly with the Cuban government, when possible. We stand in solidarity with human rights organizations in Cuba, and we stand especially with those persons who are imprisoned for the sake of conscience.<font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
