 <tr class="FAC-bodyoftable"><td colspan=2 bgcolor=#DDDaC8><b>Submitted Petition Text:</b><hr>
<font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >Amend Resolution 321 as follows: <br> <b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> </b><strike> Whereas, </strike> The United Methodist Church affirms the <b>right and custom of&nbsp;&nbsp;the </b>use of biblical language and images in <b>all its forms in </b>worship and in our common life together<strike> ,</strike>&nbsp; <b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Phrases such as "Lord," and "King," and "Father" are an integral part of the rich heritage of the faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;A truly inclusive church will not restrict its people as to what is appropriate and what is inappropriate language and imagery about God.&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore affirm the use of biblical language and images in all its forms as appropriate for use in hymns, liturgy, teaching, and in all areas of our common life together.</b><strike> and affirms the use of language that reflects the long-standing commitment to the inclusiveness and diversity of United Methodist members and constituencies, <br> Therefore, be it resolved, that United Methodist clergy and laity be encouraged to use diverse metaphorical images from the Bible, including masculine/feminine metaphors; use language for humans that reflects both male and female; use metaphors of color, darkness, ability, and age in positive rather than exclusively negative ways; and <br> Be it further resolved, that publications, audiovisual media, and other materials of The United Methodist Church shall reflect the diverse biblical metaphors, as well as language that reflects the diversity and inclusiveness of humanity. <br> <b></strike> The church throughout the ages has understood that the biblical message is both inclusive and exclusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;We find Scripture's inclusive component expressed in Genesis 1:27, 2 Peter 3:9 and elsewhere. <br> However, Christ declares an exclusive element also: "You cannot serve God and wealth" (Matthew 6:24); "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven..." (Matthew 7:21); :I am the way, and the truth, and the life.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6).&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt to ignore or sidestep or explain away this exclusive element diminishes the biblical message and undermines the church's witness. <br> We cannot be faithful to the biblical message and omit those elements that offend the unbelieving world: "...we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jew and foolishness to Gentiles" (! Corinthians 1:23).&nbsp;&nbsp;The church has faces this reality for 2,000 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate Christian response is not to abandon that which offends, but to proclaim the truth with increasing clarity, to speak the truth in love.&nbsp;&nbsp;Missionary bishop Lesslie Newbigin highlighted this reality in the mission field where "one is accustomed to the situation where you know that what you're saying runs counter to the dominant culture, but nevertheless you have to say it.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Interview with Andrew Walker.) <br> God's title, "Father." is under attack from many quarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslims consider the term blasphemous because they conceive God's fatherhood only in a narrow biological sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others who have known only abusive earthly fathers also object to the title.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we cannot abandon it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ himself told us to call God Father (Matthew 6:9, Luke 11:2).&nbsp;&nbsp;Denying or derogating God's fatherhood is Muslim theology.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not Muslims. <br> Similarly, though some Scriptures describe God using female metaphors (e.g., Luke 13:34), we cannot call God "Mother."&nbsp;&nbsp;Goddess worship has characterized the most patriarchal societies throughout history.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mormons sing their hopes of meeting a Mother in Heaven alongside the Father.&nbsp;&nbsp;Christian Scientists pray to "Mother God."&nbsp;&nbsp;We are neither Mormons nor Christian Scientists. <br> Nor can we in the name of inclusiveness give up the generic use of the word man.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Christian faith is timeless.&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot surrender to the linguistic peculiarities of this or any age.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent misguided efforts to make all language gender-neutral have given birth to linguistic monsters such as "Godself" And have slandered hymnwriters and preachers of earlier generations by rewriting their sermons and hymns.&nbsp;&nbsp;A gender-neutral version of "The Church's One Foundation" (<i>United Methodist Hymnal</i>), <br> #546) robs the hymn and the church of the biblical imagery of the church as the Bride of Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such literalism is to be deplored, not encouraged. <br> This position on Biblical language should not be discounted as outworn, sexist, anti-woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;The late Georgia Harkness, the mother of United Methodist feminist theologians, declared God's fatherhood to be one of "the great ideas of the Bible" and insisted that "No understanding of God that leaves out his fatherly love and care foe all his children. and with it the implied brotherhood of all men, can be fully Christian. (<i>Toward Understanding the Bible, Scribners', </i>1954). <br> She held to this position even in an interview given one month before her death (<i>United Methodists Today, </i>October 1974):&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe because Jesus spoke of God as Father, so should we.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certainly not going to call God 'she.' then the only alternative is 'it,'&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going to use that."&nbsp;&nbsp;She said further in that same interview:&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to me we had better accept the fact that our language uses the word man not solely as male but in a generic sense of human." <br> There are many arenas where gender-neutral language is appropriate and desirable.&nbsp;&nbsp;But where the pursuit of gender-neutrality distorts or destroys biblical metaphors, diminishes the Christian message, and censors the speech of individual Spirit-filled Christians, the effort promotes not freedom, but rather tyranny.</b><strike> <br> </font><p align="right"><b></strike><font SIZE="1" FACE="Times New Roman" >ADOPTED 1988&nbsp;&nbsp; REVISED AND ADOPTED 2000 <br> </font></b></b></p></b><font SIZE="2" FACE="Times New Roman" ><br> <font FACE="Tahoma">
