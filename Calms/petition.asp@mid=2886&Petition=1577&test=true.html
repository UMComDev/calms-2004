The resolution was referred to the General Council on Finance and Administration due to its financial implications.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> The General Board of Higher Education and Ministry has begun the process of developing this endowment fund by hiring additional staff in the United Methodist Higher Education Foundation dedicated to this specific fundraising project. A survey was conducted of influential persons in The United Methodist Church and at these black colleges to determine the level of interest in this project, and best methodology to initiate the fundraising effort. Follow-up survey work and strategic planning around the future course of the fundraising effort are currently underway. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2000 General Conference adopted Calendar Item 545, a resolution calling for support of the continuation and/or establishment of a group of &ldquo;Racial-Ethnic Plans and Initiatives.&rdquo; These included Strengthening the Black Church for the 21</sub><sup>st</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;Century, the Native American Comprehensive Plan, the Korean-American Plan for Ministry, the Asian American Language Ministries Task Force, the Shared Mission Focus on Young People, and the National Plan for Hispanic Ministry. In Report 17, the General Council on Finance and Administration made its recommendations on support of these plans to the 2000 General Conference, and that report was adopted. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2000 General Conference adopted Calendar Item 150, a resolution calling for general boards, agencies, and publishers to use recycled and &ldquo;processed chlorine free&rdquo; (PCF) paper where economically feasible. It also asked the United Methodist publishers to collaborate in a study of ways to facilitate progress toward the goal of &ldquo;processed chlorine free&rsquo; paper, and report on progress to the 2004 General Conference. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> Paper manufacturers use various bleaching processes to break down the lignin in wood fibers and whiten the pulp. When a paper is identified as PCF, it means that while the pulp used to make the paper may contain chlorine, the additional processes required at the mill to make the final product do not involve the use of chlorine. If the initial bleaching process for the pulp uses oxygenated compounds rather than elemental chlorine gas, elemental chlorine free (ECF) paper is produced. Some chlorine may be introduced if pulp made using recycled paper is included in the processing. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The General Board of Discipleship (GBOD) and United Methodist Communications (UMCom) report that wherever practical, text and cover papers used in the printing of magazines, books, newspapers, newsletters, etc. are either PCF or ECF. A survey of the printers who manufacture books for the GBOD units (Upper Room Ministries/ Discipleship Resources) book titles confirmed that the text and cover papers stocked by them and specified for use in their titles are designated as PCF or ECF.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> For all photocopying purposes within the General Board of Discipleship recycled multi-purpose paper is used. Wherever possible, UMCom uses paper that contains 10-25% post-consumer recycled material. The use of PCF and ECF papers in publications from the General Board of Discipleship and UMCom gives great support to the elimination of dioxins in water. They will continue to specify the use of these papers. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The United Methodist Publishing House reported the following information with respect to paper purchased directly for curriculum, Disciple, bulletins, and some magazines. A third of this paper is ECF, with varied levels of recycled content; less than 2% is PCF, with relatively higher levels of recycled content; and two thirds is total chlorine free (TCF), with no recycled content. There is a trade-off between totally chorine free paper and recycled content because the mill producing TCF paper using recycled content would have to certify that the recycled stock was produced in a chlorine free process, and that is not possible for post-consumer recycled materials. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> UMPH has also explored the availability of alternative papers that achieve a good balance of recycled content while minimizing the use of chlorine. They will shift to materials that demonstrate a favorable balance as those are offered in the market and when they meet the needs of the particular products for weight, brightness, opacity, and considerations for practical pricing. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In addition, they have made disclosure of both recycled content and ECF/PCF/TCF status a requirement of the specifications they solicit from printers for jobs in which the printers purchase the paper. This allows them to factor these variables into their process for selecting printing quotes and to apply the same factors even when they do not purchase the paper directly. They are aggressively pursuing all available options to achieve the best balance in the use of papers that are produced in ecologically sound ways, meet the needs of the particular resources developed for our churches, and result in affordable products.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2000 General Conference adopted Calendar Item #1560, a petition recommending creation of a task force to examine the issues of immigration and naturalization regarding compliance with applicable federal laws and regulations related to clergy appointments across The United Methodist Church in the United States. The GCFA Committee on Legal Responsibilities has begun the initial work on this complex subject and submits the following initial report on behalf of the task force: <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> In accordance with a petition adopted at the 2000 General Conference, an Immigration Task Force (&ldquo;task force&rdquo;) was organized to study the issues of immigration and naturalization as they impact upon The United Methodist Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the task force was asked to study how the Church can most effectively meet its obligations to comply with federal immigration laws and regulations. This includes an examination of which organizations within the Church are best suited to coordinate compliance, what education and guidance should be provided by the Church, and to whom this guidance should be given. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The task force met and began by addressing the key immigration issue facing the Church today - compliance with federal immigration laws for clergy under appointment. The task force discussed the implications of the <i>Weber </i>case in this context and how the employee/independent contractor distinction may affect the Church&rsquo;s approach to this problem. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The task force is preparing a survey to be circulated to the annual conferences inquiring about current practices regarding compliance with immigration laws and regulations. The responses to this survey will assist the task force in developing its future strategy to address legal compliance issues. Also, task force members Lilia Fernandez and Panravee Vongjaroenrat are working on updating a brochure, prepared by the &ldquo;Justice for Our Neighbors&rdquo; program, which could be part of a standard immigration information &ldquo;packet&rdquo; to be distributed to the annual conferences. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Finally, while the primary focus of the task force is to address the immigration needs of our clergy, the task force also recognizes a broader moral obligation to assist others, particularly those in the Church &ldquo;family,&rdquo; in securing their lawful immigration status. To this end, the task force will study ways to effectively address this larger problem and how to assist and cooperate with other like-minded organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Because of the ongoing and critical need to address immigration issues within the Church, the task force unanimously agreed to recommend that its work continue into the next quadrennium. The GCFA recommends continuation of this task force for the 2005-2008 quadrenium, with funding provided by the participating agencies on the same basis as during the 2001-2004 quadrenium. <br> <i><br> </font></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1996 General Conference adopted Calendar Item #1811, a petition and report from the General Council on Finance and Administration recommending creation of a task force to conduct a study of a broad range of issues related to the manner in which connectional ministries are funded in The United Methodist Church. That study was conducted during the 1997-2000 quadrennium by the Connectional Ministry Funding Patterns Task Force, with the results reported in the GCFA&rsquo;s Report No. 16 to the 2000 General Conference. One significant result of that study was a change in the apportionment formula for the allocation of general Church apportioned funds among the jurisdictional annual conferences. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> The General Council on Finance and Administration plans to conduct further studies during the 2005-2008 quadrennium on specific issues related to the manner in which connectional ministries are funded in the Church. A primary focus will be further study of the continued validity of the fundamental assumptions stated in the introductory section of �812 regarding the primacy of the World Service Fund in the support of ministry in the general agencies. This second phase of the CMFPTF will attempt to differentiate between fundraising practices that are currently permitted or mandated in <i>The Book of Discipline 2000 </i>and those that appear to achieve the best results in terms of the amount of money raised, and theologically sound principles of stewardship being fostered.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> A task group amenable to the GCFA will be organized consisting of four GCFA members; four general secretaries selected by the general secretaries of the general agencies; three bishops selected by the Council of Bishops; a district superintendent, and a conference treasurer or conference director of connectional ministry selected by each of the jurisdictional Colleges of Bishops. In addition, as members are selected, the GCFA will assure that there is appropriate representation of racial/ethnic minority persons, women and youth and/or young adults. The GCFA general secretary, and/or designee shall be assigned by the GCFA to support the task group. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The work of this task group will be conducted by conference call and a limited number of face-to-face meetings scheduled to coincide with the regularly scheduled meetings of the general secretaries and/or the Council of Bishops. The costs of the conference calls, other administrative expenses, and the cost of the ten jurisdictional members will be funded from administrative contingency. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Concurrently, the Sub-committee on Central Conference Matters of the Episcopal Services Committee will work on a plan to increase financial participation by our central conferences in the Episcopal Fund. This work will be done in consultation with the Central Conference College of Bishops and the Finance Committee of the Council of Bishops. <br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
