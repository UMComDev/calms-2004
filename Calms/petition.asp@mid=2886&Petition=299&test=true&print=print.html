<font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >Amend �359.1 as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >�<b> 359.</b> <i>Complaint Procedures</i>-1. <i>General Provisions</i>-Ordination and membership in an annual conference in The United Methodist Church is a sacred trust. The qualifications and duties of local pastors, associate members, probationary members, and full members are set forth in the <i>Book of Discipline </i>of The United Methodist Church, and we believe they flow from the gospel as taught by Jesus the Christ and proclaimed by his apostles. Whenever a person in any of the above categories, including those on leaves of all types, honorable or administrative location, or retirement, is accused of violating this trust, the membership of his or her ministerial office shall be subject to review. <br> This review shall have as its primary purpose a just resolution of any violations of this sacred trust, in the hope that God&rsquo;s work of justice, reconciliation and healing may be realized in the body of Christ <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">and any discussion regarding the surrender of ministerial credentials or the ministerial office by those in authority to hold such reviews shall not be permitted unless the person under review initiates such discussion</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">. <br> <i>a) Supervision</i>-In the course of the ordinary fulfillment of the superintending role, the bishop or district superintendent may receive or initiate complaints about the performance or character of a clergyperson.</sub><sup>58</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;A complaint is a written and signed statement claiming misconduct or unsatisfactory performance of ministerial duties <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">and the minister under review shall be given a copy of the complaint before any review is conducted</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">.</sub><sup>59 </sup></sub>The person filing the complaint and the clergyperson shall be informed by the district superintendent or bishop of the process for filing the complaint and its purpose.</sub><sup>60 <br> </sup></sub><i>b) Supervisory Response</i>-The supervisory response is pastoral and administrative and shall be directed toward a just resolution among all parties. It is not part of any judicial process <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">and as such no suspension from the ministerial office or duties shall result from such supervisory response</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">. At any meetings no verbatim record shall be made; <strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">no legal counsel shall be present;</strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;the person against whom the complaint was made may choose another person<b><font FACE="Times New Roman">, either lay or clergy,</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;to accompany him or her with the right to voice; the person making the complaint shall have the right to choose a person to accompany him or her with the right to voice.</sub><sup>61</sup></sub><br> The supervisory response should be carried out by the bishop and district superintendent in a confidential and timely manner, with attention to communication to all parties regarding the complaint and the process. At the determination of the bishop, persons with qualifications and experience in assessment, intervention, or healing <strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">may</strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">shall </b><font FACE="Times New Roman">be selected to assist in the supervisory response. The bishop also may consult with the committee on pastor-parish relations for pastors, the district committee on superintendency for the district superintendents, appropriate personnel committee or other persons who may be helpful. The supervisory response also may include mediation in which the parties are assisted in an agreement satisfactory to all parties by a trained, neutral third party mediator or mediation team.</sub><sup>62</sup></sub><br> <i>c) Suspension</i>-When deemed appropriate, to protect the well-being of the person making the complaint, the church, and/or clergy, the bishop, with the recommendation of the executive committee of the board of ordained ministry, may suspend the person from all clergy responsibilities, but not from an appointment, for a period not to exceed sixty days. <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">Under no circumstances shall a superintendent or bishop have the authority to suspend a clergy member without the recommendation of the executive committee of the board of ordained ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">During the suspension, salary, housing, and benefits provided by a pastoral charge will continue at a level no less than on the date of suspension.</sub><sup>63</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;The person so suspended shall retain all rights and privileges as stated in � 325. The cost of supply of a pastor during the suspension will be borne by the annual conference. <br> <i>d) Referral of a Complaint</i>-If the supervisory response does not achieve a resolution , the bishop may refer the complaint</sub><sup>64</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;as judicial or administrative based on the following criteria: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(1) <i>Judicial Complaint</i>-If the bishop determines that the complaint is based on allegations of one or more offenses listed in � 2702.1, the bishop may refer the complaint to the counsel for the Church, who shall be appointed by the bishop. The counsel for the Church shall be a clergyperson in full connection and shall have the right to choose one assistant counsel without voice who may be an attorney. The counsel for the Church shall draft and sign a judicial complaint, attaching as exhibits all relevant written materials, including but not limited to information from the supervisory process and a suggested list of witnesses as deemed appropriate, forward the judicial complaint to the committee on investigation and represent the Church in the judicial process. The statute of limitations in � 2702.4 should be considered prior to the referral of a judicial complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> (2) <i>Administrative Complaint</i>-If the bishop determines that the complaint is based on allegations of incompetence, ineffectiveness, or unwillingness or inability to perform ministerial duties, he or she may refer the complaint as an administrative complaint to the board of ordained ministry for its consideration of remedial or other action</sub><sup>65</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>see</i> � 359.3<i>a</i>). <br> </font><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >e)</i> <i>Supervisory Follow-up</i>-The bishop and cabinet shall provide a process for healing within the congregation if there has been significant disruption to congregational life by the complaint. This process <strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">may</strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">shall </b><font FACE="Times New Roman">include sharing of information by the bishop and/or cabinet about the nature of the complaint without disclosing alleged facts, which may compromise any possible forthcoming administrative or judicial process. This <strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">may</strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">shall </b><font FACE="Times New Roman">include a mediation process for unresolved conflicts, support for victims, and reconciliation for parties involved.</sub><sup>66</sup></sub><font FACE="Tahoma">
