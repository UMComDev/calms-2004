 <tr class="FAC-bodyoftable"><td colspan=2 bgcolor=#DDDaC8><b>Submitted Petition Text:</b><hr>
<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAN <br> </b><br> Iran is a theocracy run largely by Muslim clerics. Its most powerful governing bodies are not elected or accountable to elected officials. All candidates and holders of public office must adhere to the Iranian government&rsquo;s version of Islam. The civil code is based on Islamic law and calls for flogging, stoning, amputation, or death for a wide range of criminal and political offenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;The media are controlled or restricted by the government. The courts are not independent. Women are not guaranteed equal rights in many cases and must adhere to dress codes, among other restrictions. Religious minorities, including Christians, cannot hold senior government positions and face other restrictions. Members of the Bahai faith are especially persecuted. According to Amnesty International and other international human rights groups, torture is used by the Iranian security services.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Freedom of Speech - </b>Television and radio broadcasts are directly controlled by the government. The Press Court, which overseas the media, can prosecute journalists for &ldquo;insulting Islam&rdquo; or &ldquo;damaging&rdquo; the government. Since 2000, over 84 publications have been closed by the courts and dozens of journalists have been arrested. Demonstrations that &ldquo;violate the principles of Islam&rdquo; are forbidden. Student dissidents, academics, and human rights lawyers have been harassed and arrested for their criticism of the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workers&rsquo; House is the only legal trade union. Strikes are illegal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Free Elections -&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The unelected Council of Guardians ensures that all candidates to elected bodies are loyal to the theocracy and its Islamic principles. Of 814 candidates for president in 2001, only ten were approved. The supreme leader is chosen for life by the Assembly of Experts, comprised of clerics with eight-year terms elected from among a list of government-approved candidates. Political parties are allowed if they do not question the Islamic basis of the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Political Prisoners - </b>The death penalty and degrading punishments have been employed against prisoners of conscience. By some counts, political prisoners in Iran number in the thousands and possibly in the tens of thousands. Iran&rsquo;s security services commit arbitrary arrests and perform incommunicado detentions of regime opponents. Suspected dissidents are often detained in illegal detention centers. Efforts by the elected assembly to restrict the powers of the security agencies, such as limits on torture, have been overruled by the Council of Guardians. Politically sensitive cases are handled by special Revolutionary Courts, which have even less accountability and where inmates are denied lawyers and due process. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Religious Freedom - </b>The official religion of Iran is Shiite Islam. The constitution recognizes Zoroastrians, Jews. and Christians as religious minorities. Bahai&rsquo;s are Iran&rsquo;s largest religious minority but have almost no legal rights. They cannot legally own property, attend universities, or be married in the ceremonies of their own faith. The United Nations Special Representative has estimated there may be 300,000 Christians in Iran and that they are emigrating at the rate of 15,000 to 20,000 a year. All religious minorities suffer some degree of officially approved discrimination, especially in employment, education, and housing. All public school students must study Islam. Muslim women may not marry non-Muslim men. The government often acts to restrict and punish evangelism. Conversion away from Islam can incur a death penalty. The government has been especially restrictive toward Protestants, some of whose churches have been closed and converts arrested. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Women&rsquo;s Rights - </b>Women lack equal rights in laws about divorce laws, child custody disputes, and inheritance. Legal testimony by women carries half the weight of a man&rsquo;s. Women must conform to Islamic dress codes and are segregated in most public places. Women cannot obtain a passport without permission from husbands or male relatives. Women of all ages cannot marry without permission from male relatives. The legal age of marriage for women is nine. Men, even if already married, are legally entitled to temporary marriages with as many women as they choose. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>OUR RESPONSE <br> </b><br> The United Methodist Church calls for the creation and protection of basic human rights and&nbsp;&nbsp;democratic liberties in Iran. We pray for all Iranians, especially for the church in Iran. In particular, we pray for full religious freedom, a free press, free elections, equal rule of all for all people, and the abolition of torture. We shall be an advocate for human rights and democratic reforms within Iran in our interactions with the U.S. government and other governments, with ecumenical organizations, and directly with the Iranian government, when possible. We stand in solidarity with human rights advocates in Iran.<font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
