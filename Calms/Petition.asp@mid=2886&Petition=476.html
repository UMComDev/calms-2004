<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Amend �359 as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> �<b> 359.</b> <i>Complaint Procedures</i>-1. <i>General Provisions</i>-<strike> Ordination and membership in an annual conference in The United Methodist Church is a sacred trust. The qualifications and duties of local pastors, associate members, probationary members, and full members are set forth in the <i>Book of Discipline </i>of The United Methodist Church, and we believe they flow from the gospel as taught by Jesus the Christ and proclaimed by his apostles. Whenever a person in any of the above categories, including those on leaves of all types, honorable or administrative location, or retirement, is accused of violating this trust, the membership of his or her ministerial office shall be subject to review. <br> This review shall have as its primary purpose a just resolution of any violations of this sacred trust, in the hope that God&rsquo;s work of justice, reconciliation and healing may be realized in the body of Christ. <br> </font><b></strike><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >In the course of their work with the bishop, two types of supervision are required of district superintendents: <i>Administrative and Ordinary Supervision. Administrative Supervision </i>includes discussion of all matters where a pastor&rsquo;s leadership and performance is being brought into question, whether through written and signed complaint or oral presentations of concern regarding the violation of their sacred trust. These shall all be done in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, particularly in regard to </b><font FACE="Windsor Lt BT">�<font FACE="Times New Roman">359.2.<b> <i>Fair Process in Administrative Hearings</i>. Any clergy may have an elder in full connection who is in good standing, as defined by the Conference Board of Ordained Ministry, present with them for any <i>Administrative </i>or <i>Ordinary Supervisory </i>meeting as an advocate with voice should they so desire. At any supervisory meeting where the bishop and one or more district superintendent is present or where more than one district superintendent is present, the clergyperson may have an advocate present with him or her. The clergyperson must be notified of the meeting with the bishop and one or more district superintendents or with more than one district superintendent a minimum of ten days prior to the meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure on the part of the bishop or district superintendents to fulfill this process of notification and right to advocacy shall result in the right to direct appeal to the Judicial Council by the person whose rights have been violated.<font SIZE="3">&nbsp; <font SIZE="2">Bishops and superintendents found to be in violation of this process shall be required to attend special training for appropriate methods of supervision. This will protect clergy rights and encourage pastoral care for clergy who are damaged by the failure of the bishop and superintendents to follow the appropriate procedures. <i><br> </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The annual conference shall be empowered to nominate and elect from the floor of executive session of the clergy at annual conference a <i>Supervisory Investigations Committee </i>as a standing committee of the annual conference. The <i>Supervisory Investigations Committee</i> stands outside of the authority of the bishop to assure a true <i>separation of powers</i> in the investigative process. Members of the committee shall be guaranteed protection from retributive action as they conduct their business. The <i>Supervisory Investigations Committee </i>shall be comprised of nine members. These persons will serve four-year terms, up to a maximum of two consecutive terms. Six of these are to be nominated and elected by the total <i>executive clergy session</i>. In addition three members will be nominated by the members of the Conference Board of Ordained Ministry and <i>elected at the executive session of the clergy</i>. The <i>Supervisory Investigations Committee</i> shall receive all complaints against clergy, including those regarding the potential abuse of the administrative supervision provision noted above. All complaints shall be submitted directly to the Chair of the Conference Board of Ordained Ministry. The <i>Supervisory Investigations Committee </i>shall follow the guidelines of <i>The Discipline of The United Methodist Church </i>regarding the process of investigation. When a complaint is made against the bishop or district superintendents regarding the failure to follow the process of referral of a complaint as found in this paragraph, the <i>Supervisory Investigations Committee</i> shall determine whether a fine is to be imposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Administrative Supervision </i>includes the following: <br> </b><i>a) <b>Administrative </b>Supervision</i>-In the course of the ordinary fulfillment of the superintending role, the bishop or district superintendent may receive or initiate complaints about the performance or character of a clergyperson.</sub><sup>58</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;A complaint is a written and signed statement claiming misconduct or unsatisfactory performance of ministerial duties.</sub><sup>59 </sup></sub>The person filing the complaint and the clergyperson shall be informed by the district superintendent or bishop of the process for filing the complaint and its purpose.</sub><sup>60</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>All complaints properly received or initiated shall be turned over immediately to the Chair of the Board of Ordained Ministry. These shall then be turned over to the <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Supervisory Investigations Committee </i><font FACE="Times New Roman">for review and investigation to determine the best manner with which to handle the complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b></b></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" ><br> </font><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >b) Supervisory Response</i>-The supervisory response is pastoral <strike> and administrative and shall be directed</strike>&nbsp; <b>until such time that counsel is received from the Executive Committee of the Conference Board of Ordained Ministry. This counsel is based on the results of the discovery of the <i>Supervisory Investigations Committee</i> that a complaint has just cause for moving forward to trial. At that time supervisory administrative action maybe needed. Where administrative action is not required the pastoral response shall continue to work </b>toward a just resolution among all parties. It is not part of any judicial process. At any meetings no verbatim record shall be made; no legal counsel shall be present; the person against whom the complaint was made may choose another person to accompany him or her with the right to voice; the person making the complaint shall have the right to choose a person to accompany him or her with the right to voice.</sub><sup>61</sup></sub><br> The supervisory response should be carried out by <strike> the bishop and district superintendent</strike>&nbsp; <b>all parties involved </b>in a confidential and timely manner, with attention to communication to all parties regarding the complaint and the process. At the determination of the <strike> bishop</strike>&nbsp; <b>Investigations Committee</b>, persons with qualifications and experience in assessment, intervention, or healing may be selected to assist in the supervisory response. <b>Such persons shall be those with whom all parties in the dispute are fully comfortable. Participation in such a process shall be required of all parties to the complaint, to include the person(s) making the complaint. The Conference Board of Ordained Ministry shall have the responsibility of assisting in the identification of qualified persons or organization to assist in the healing process, assuring that the confidentiality of all parties is held inviolate. Those found to be in violation of</b> <b>any party&rsquo;s confidentiality shall be subject to a fine to be determined by the Executive Committee of the Board of Ordained Ministry as approved by the Executive Session of the Clergy Session of the Annual Conference. </b>The bishop <b>and/or district superintendents </b>also may consult with the committee on pastor-parish relations for pastors, the district committee on superintendency for the district superintendents, appropriate personnel committee or other persons who may be helpful. The supervisory response also may include mediation in which the parties are assisted in an agreement satisfactory to all parties by a trained, neutral third party mediator or mediation team <b>where so indicated by the <i>Supervisory Investigations Committee</i>. Again the Conference Board of Ordained Ministry shall have the responsibility of assisting in the identification of a qualified person or organization to assist in the healing process, assuring that the confidentiality of all parties is held inviolate.</b>.</sub><sup>62</sup></sub><br> </font></i></i><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >c) Suspension</i>-When .... <br> </font></i></i><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >d) Referral of a Complaint</i>-If the <strike> supervisory response does not achieve a resolution , the bishop may refer the complaint</sub><sup>64</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;as judicial or administrative based on the following criteria<b><i></strike>&nbsp;Supervisory Investigations Committee</i> determines that judicial or administrative action is justified and/or required, the following criteria shall be followed</b>: <br> </font></i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(1) <i>Judicial Complaint</i>-If the <strike> bishop</strike>&nbsp; <b><i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Supervisory Investigations Committee </b></i><font FACE="Times New Roman">determines that the complaint is based on allegations of one or more offenses listed in � 2702.1, the <strike> bishop</strike>&nbsp; <b><i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Supervisory Investigations Committee </b></i><font FACE="Times New Roman">may refer the complaint to the counsel for the Church, who shall be appointed by the bishop. The counsel for the Church shall be a clergyperson in full connection and shall have the right to choose one assistant counsel without voice who may be an attorney. The counsel for the Church shall draft and sign a judicial complaint, attaching as exhibits all relevant written materials, including but not limited to information from the <strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">s<b><i></strike> S</b>upervisory <b>Investigations Committee </b></i><font FACE="Times New Roman">process and a suggested list of witnesses as deemed appropriate, forward the judicial complaint to the committee on investigation and represent the Church in the judicial process. The statute of limitations in � 2702.4 should be considered prior to the referral of a judicial complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> (2) <i>Administrative Complaint</i>-If the bishop <b><i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Supervisory Investigations Committee </b></i><font FACE="Times New Roman">determines that the complaint is based on allegations of incompetence, ineffectiveness, or unwillingness or inability to perform ministerial duties, <strike> he or she</strike>&nbsp; <b>the <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Supervisory Investigations Committee </b></i><font FACE="Times New Roman">may refer the complaint as an administrative complaint to the board of ordained ministry for its consideration of remedial or other action</sub><sup>65</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>see</i> � 359.3<i>a</i>). <br> </font><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >e)</i> <i>Supervisory Follow-up</i>-The bishop ....</sub><sup><br> </sup></sub>2. <i>Fair Process in Administrative Hearings</i>-.... <br> <i>a)</i> In any administrative proceeding .... <br> <i>b)</i> Notice of any hearing shall advise the respondent of the reason for the proposed procedures with sufficient detail to allow the respondent to prepare a response. Notice shall be given not less than twenty days prior to <strike> the</strike>&nbsp; <b>any individual </b>hearing <b>or supervisory interviews related to a complaint</b>. <br> <i>c)</i> The respondent.... <br> <i>d)</i> In any administrative hearing, .... <br> <i>e)</i> The respondent shall .... <br> <i>f)</i> In the event that a clergyperson fails to appear for <b>duly called </b>supervisory interviews, refuses mail, refuses to communicate personally with the bishop or district superintendent, or otherwise fails to respond to supervisory requests or requests from official administrative committees, <b>once a formal complaint has been referred, </b>such actions or inactions shall not be used as an excuse to avoid or delay any Church processes, and such processes may continue without the participation of such individual. <br> <i>g)</i> In order to preserve .... <br> </font></i></i><b><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >h) </i>Bishops, district superintendents, personnel committee members, or persons in local church membership shall not violate federal or state laws regarding confidentiality in regard to the making of references for future employment of a clergy found to be in violation of the authority of bishops or superintendents regarding appointments. There are many denominations which place no value at all on episcopal processes. To state that a person would be ineffective in another denominational setting on the basis of our episcopal system is a serious ethical violation of that person's human rights and damages his or her ability to find and obtain other future employment in ministry outside of The United Methodist Church, should he or she feel called to leave our connection. The United Methodist Church does not condone such action, nor will the Church protect those who violate such laws from prosecution by invoking the First Amendment of the United States Constitution in their defense, should they violate this sacred trust. <i><br> </b></i>3. <i>Disposition of Administrative Complaints</i>-When a complaint has been received, the <strike> board of ordained ministry</strike>&nbsp; <b><i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Supervisory Investigations Committee</i><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; </b>shall develop a response in a timely manner.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This response may be simply calling for outside mediation to reconcile differences between various parties involved or include referral to trial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The complaint shall be referred to a committee of the board that deals with matters of conference relations (other than the executive committee) and this committee shall conduct an administrative hearing following the fair process provisions of � 2. The <strike> bishop or a cabinet representative</strike>&nbsp; <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">chair of the <i>Supervisory Investigations Committee </b></i><font FACE="Times New Roman">shall present the administrative complaint to the committee. The respondent shall be given an opportunity to address the administrative complaint in person, in writing and with the assistance of a clergyperson in full connection, with voice. Once the committee has heard <b>from the chair of the <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Supervisory Investigations Committee </b></i><strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">the cabinet representative</strike> , the respondent, and others as determined by the chairperson of the committee, it may recommend remedial action, discontinuance, leave of absence, administrative location, dismissal of the complaint or such other action that it deems appropriate, to the board of ordained ministry. The board may accept or amend the recommendations of the committee, or it may dismiss the complaint. In rare instances, the board may refer the complaint back to the <strike> bishop</strike>&nbsp; <b><i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Supervisory Investigations Committee </b></i><font FACE="Times New Roman">for possible referral as a judicial complaint. The board&rsquo;s response will be shared with the clergyperson, the bishop, the cabinet, and the person bringing the original complaint. <br> </font></b></b></i></i><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >a) Remedial Action</i>-In <strike> cooperation</strike>&nbsp; <b>consultation </b>with the cabinet and <strike> in consultation with</strike>&nbsp;the clergyperson, the board of ordained ministry may choose or recommend one or more of the following options for a program of remedial action, subject to regular oversight by the board and annual review: <br>  ...... <br> <font FACE="Tahoma">
