<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT" SIZE="3" ><br> <b></i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT">Report No. 13 <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT"><font SIZE="3"><br> <b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT"><font SIZE="3">REPORT ON THE ORIENTATION AND TRAINING EVENT FOR NEW DISTRICT <br> SUPERINTENDENTS AND DIRECTORS OF CONNECTIONAL MINISTRIES <br> </b><i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT"><br> The Book of Discipline, 2000 </i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">states that the General Council on Ministries (GCOM) has the <br> responsibility to provide for the training of the annual conference council on ministries directors <br> (now called Directors of Connectional Ministries) and to provide jointly with the General Board of <br> Higher Education and Ministry (GBHEM) and the Council of Bishops for the training of district <br> superintendents (ï¿½906.13). This annual experience consistently receives extremely positive <br> evaluations from the participants and episcopal leaders of the church. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In fulfilling this responsibility, five members of the GCOM plus the general secretary and an <br> additional staff person were assigned to the twenty-one member Planning Committee for the New <br> Annual Conference Cabinet Member Training Event. Seven members of the Council of Bishops <br> plus five members and two staff persons of the GBHEM also served on the Planning Committee <br> which designed and implemented the training experience for newly appointed district <br> superintendents and directors of connectional ministries. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The training events were held annually at Lake Junaluska, North Carolina during the last week of <br> August. The event theme was &ldquo; Feasting Around God&rsquo;s Table.&rdquo; Worship, spiritual formation, <br> Bible study, role identity, clarification of responsibilities, information sharing, skill training, selfcare, <br> and development in management and administrative techniques composed the core <br> curriculum for each event. The general agencies provided resources through displays and a <br> mission and ministry fair. The fair was organized into four sections: congregational development <br> and revitalization, disciple making, financial resources for mission, and mission initiatives. On <br> average, twelve conference council directors and ninety district superintendents attended each <br> annual training session. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The Planning Committee placed emphasis on self-care to enhance spirituality and develop more <br> effective ways for modeling holistic leadership. A global awareness of The United Methodist <br> Church was recognized as a valid aspect of the training. The Planning Committee members had <br> conversations with central conference representatives. The central conference bishops were asked <br> to select a few superintendents and directors to take part in the US event towards the development <br> of appropriate orientation and training in the central conferences. Also at the request of the <br> Commission on Pan Methodist Cooperation and Union, an invitation was extended to the Black <br> Methodist denominations for representatives to participate in the event. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The district superintendent workshops focused on their disciplinary assignments: administration, <br> personnel, and supervision along with legal concerns and leadership. The director of connectional <br> ministries workshops utilized the five transformational directions to examine their responsibilities. <br> Plenary session topics included dealing with conflict, multicultural ministry settings, and <br> congregational development. Each year the planning committee made adjustments to assist these <br> conference leaders to become acquainted with innovative ways for advancing ministry. <br> Forty to forty-five persons served as faculty annually. Persons were selected for their expertise and <br> experience as bishops, district superintendents, directors of connectional ministries, and general <br> agency or conference staff. Inclusiveness of women and racial ethnic persons in the faculty <br> leadership team was an intentional goal. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Signed________________________________________ <br> Bishop Edward W.
