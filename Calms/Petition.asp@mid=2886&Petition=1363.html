 <tr class="FAC-bodyoftable"><td colspan=2 bgcolor=#DDDaC8><b>Submitted Petition Text:</b><hr>
<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Delete �901&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> This deletion will require that a number of additional paragraphs be modified or deleted. This includes the deletion of �902-�907. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The distribution of responsibilities enumerated in �906 requires the following modifications to other sections of the discipline: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 1. Council of Bishops would take over responsibility. To make this explicit, �427 needs to be amended by adding: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >5. It is the responsibility of the Council of Bishops upon a two-thirds vote of the members of the Council of Bishops present and voting, to make changes in missional priorities or special programs necessitated by emergencies or by other significant developments between General Conferences that substantially affect the life of the Church; provided that such adjustments are made after consultation with the affected boards and agencies and approval by a two-thirds vote of the General Council on Finance and Administration.</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; <br> </font></b></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >2. General Council on Finance and Administration would assume full responsibility. This is already taken care of by �805.5b. However, the specific steps described in �806.1 need to be amended by removing �806.1a through �806.1b(7). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 3. This responsibility needs to be explicitly given to the General Council on Finance and Administration by adding to �806 a section �806.13: <br> <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">To designate the general agency to undertake a special study ordered by the General Conference when the conference fails to make such a designation. <br> </b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> 4. This responsibility needs to be explicitly given to the General Council on Finance and Administration by adding to �806 a section �806.14: <br> <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">To assign responsibilities for implementation of themes, missional priorities, and/or special programs initiated between sessions of the General Conference to the general program agencies or to special task forces created by the General Council on Finance and Administration.</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 5. This is already the purpose of the General Commission on Religion and Race as defined in �2002. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 6. The common calendar of church wide meetings needs to be kept by the Council on Finance and Administration. Add to �807: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman">22. To maintain a calendar of meetings on behalf of all agencies of The United Methodist Church as an aid to the agencies in regulating the number and the timing of such meetings.</b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 7. These responsibilities need to be given to the Council of Bishops and the General Council on Finance and Administration by adding&nbsp;&nbsp;to �427: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman">6. The Council of Bishops shall recommend the number and timing of special days that are to be observed on a church wide basis; provided that the General Council on Finance and Administration shall make recommendations to the General Conference as set forth in �807.3 regarding the special days to be observed with offering; and provided, further, that the General Council on Finance and Administration may authorize a special appeal in an emergency. <br> </b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> 8. This is the responsibility of all agencies. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 9. Each agency can determine its own publication needs. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 10. Each agency can consult with the General Commission on Communication and the United Publishing House regarding publication policies. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 11. These functions have proved to be impossible for the GCOM to fulfill. No amendments are necessary. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 12. It is the responsibility of every agency, annual conference, congregation and individual to identify ways that the connectional structure could be improved and to make recommendations to the General Conference. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 13. These responsibilities can be cared for by the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry and the Council of Bishops. To make this explicit �427 needs to be amended by adding: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman">12. To provide for the training of annual conference council on ministries directors or equivalent, to provide jointly with the Council of Bishops the training of district superintendents, and to consult with Central Conferences concerning comparable training sessions. <br> </b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> 14. Internal evaluation is the responsibility of every agency. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 15. This is the responsibility of the General Board of Church and Society. It is already implied in �1003 but it needs to be amended by adding �1003.5 <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman">To keep under review the concurrence of general program agencies with the Social Principles of The United Methodist Church. <br> </b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> 16. The election of general secretaries is spelled out in �713. It needs to be amended by substituting: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman">The general secretary of each general program agency shall be elect annually by ballot of the members. <br> For: The general secretary of each general program agency that is accountable to the General Council on Ministries shall be elected annually by ballot of the General Council on Ministries upon the nomination of the agency involved. Any general secretary of a general program agency who has not been elected by the General council on Ministries shall not serve in such capacity beyond the end of that calendar year. <br> </b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> 17. The research function of the General Board of Discipleship needs to be enlarged by editing �1102.10 by substituting: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman">ways for the church to be effective. This includes tracking research conducted by other agencies and initiating research for the benefit of the whole church.</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; <strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">ways to help persons achieve the purpose set forth in �1101. This responsibility will include authority for experimentation and research in all areas of ministry assigned to the&nbsp;&nbsp;General board of Discipleship and will encourage cooperation with other agencies in the conduct of such research and experimentation. <br> </strike><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> 18. See number 7 above. <br> 19. This is the responsibility of every agency. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 20. It is the responsibility of every agency to report program changes and the responsibility of the General Conference to identify structure overlap. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 21. It is the responsibility of the General Conference to remove all time-dated material from the Book of Resolutions and Book of Discipline. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 22. The General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious Concerns does not need to have "various aspects of ecumenism" referred to it. This is its responsibility. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 23. The Advance Committee properly belongs with the General Board of Finance and Administration. �807 needs to be amended by adding: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman">22. To organize the Advance Committee, which shall have general oversight of the Advance program. <br> </b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> 24. The World Service Special gifts Committee properly belongs with the General Board of Finance and Administration. �807 needs to be amended by adding: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman">23. To organize World Service Special Gifts Committee, which shall have oversight of the World Service Special gifts program. <br> </b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> 25. This function is not necessary. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 26. This function properly belongs with the General Council on Finance and Administration. �807 needs to be amended by adding: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman">24. To establish a procedure for making a quadrennial review, initiating proposals, and/or responding to proposals by the general agencies regarding the location of headquarters and staff and report the same to the General Conference. <br> </b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> Other paragraphs that need to be amended include: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Delete �807.2, �807.3. �807.4 <br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
