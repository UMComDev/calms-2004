<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Amend Rolution #181 as follows:<i><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> I.</i><br> Christianity ... <br> But the life ... <br> The central ... <br> II <br> The movement to improve the status of women is one of the most profoundly hopeful of our times. The United Methodist Church<b>, recognizing that equality between women and men is a matter of social justice, </b> in various ways has sought to support that movement. Although...&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> There is increasing awareness that we cannot solve world problems <b>associated with globalization and unequal disrribution of resources </b><strike> of hunger, </strike> population growth, poverty, and peace so long as the talents and potential of half the world&rsquo;s people are disregarded and even repressed. There are strong interrelationships between all these problems and the status of women. <br> <strike> The years from 1975 to 1985 were designated the Decade for Women, a time for correcting these ancient injustices. For Christians, it is a time for repentance and for new dedication to Christ&rsquo;s ideal of equality. It was a time for examining specific areas that need to be addressed in societies: <br> Economics.</strike>&nbsp; <br> </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The International movement for the equality of women formally began in 1975, with the proclamation of International Women's Year by the United Nations General Assembly. The United Nations Decade for Women (1976-1985) which followed was a world-wide effort to examine the status and rights of women at all levels. For Christians, it was a time for repentance and for new dedication to Christ's ideal of equality.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In 1995, the Fourth World Conference on Women succeeded in bringing about a new and international commitment to the goals of equality, development and peace for all women, and moved the global movement for the advancement of women into the twenty-first century. The Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action constitute a powerful agenda for women's empowerment and gender equality. <br> The Beijing Platform for Action defined a set of strategic objectives and spelled out actions to be taken by governments and civil society in the following twelve critical areas of concern: poverty, economy, power and decision-making, education, media, health , armed conflict, environment, violence, human rights, the girl child and the institutional mechanisms for the advancement of women.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>Economics:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><font FACE="Times New Roman">As part of the Beijing Platform for Action, statisticians were called upon to develop a more comprehensive knowledge of all forms of work and employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">Often the productive labor... In more industrialized societies, the enormous amount of volunteer work done by women is not counted as adding to the nation&rsquo;s wealth. <br> <b>Although the gender gap in rates of economic activity is narrowing, the nature of women's and men's participation in the labor force continues to be very different. Women have always engaged in the less formal types of work, working as unpaid workers in a family business, in the informal sector or in various types of household economic activities. They also continue to receive less pay than men. In manufacturing, for example, in 27 of the 39 countries with data available, women's wages were 20 to 50 per cent less than those of men. <i>Power and decision-making. <br> </font></b></b></b></i><strike><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >In the United States, nearly half of all women are working outside the home in the paid labor force, and there are well-publicized professional successes, yet actually, the earning gap between men and women is greater than it was in the 1950s. Everywhere, women tend to be clustered in the lower-paying jobs and in certain stereotyped job fields. <br> Legal Rights.</strike>&nbsp;In 1945, only 31 countries ... <br> In the United States, some of the more glaring inequities are being corrected step by step.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>However, women are still under represented in all branches of the government. The 75 women sworn into the 108</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress in January 2003, account for only 13.8% of the 540 members. Twenty states will have no women serving in the 108</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress. Six states - Alaska, Delaware, Iowa, Mississippi, New Hampshire and Vermont - have never sent a woman to the US Congress. </b><strike> Nonetheless, a 1978 report of the Civil Rights Commission noted continuing discrimination on the basis of sex in the federal statutes.</sub><sup>1</sup></sub><br> Cultural Factors.</strike>&nbsp; <b>Violence Against Women.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The perception... The fact that two thirds of the world&rsquo;s <b>876 million </b>illiterates are female is evidence of continuing disparity in importance given to the education of boys and girls. <br> Traditional perceptions of female qualities also are a factor in the widespread domestic violence against women, now coming to be recognized as a tragically widespread occurrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nearly one third of women in the world report being physically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives.</b><br> </font></strike></strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Human Rights</i> <i>in Fertility Decisions.</i> Throughout ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> While societal needs... <br> </font></i></i><b><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >HIV/Aids and Women. </i>According to recent Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, women now account for almost half of the 36.4 million adults currently living with HIV/AIDS and of the 12.7 million adults who have died from the disease since the epidemic began. In 1999, 52 per cent of the 2.1 million adults who died from AIDS worldwide were women. The majority of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. where women account for 55 per cent of those infected with HIV/AIDS. There are 12 African women currently infected with the virus for every 10 African men. Women's risk of becoming infected with HIV during unprotected sexual intercourse is also known to be two to four times higher than that of men.</b><br> </font></b></b></i></i><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The Beijing Platform for Action recognizes that social and cultural factors often increase women's vulnerability to HIV and may determine the course that the infection takes in their lives. Women too often do not have the power to insist on safe and responsible sex practices and have little access to public health information and services, both of which have been found to be effective in preventing the disease and/or slowing its progress. <br> <i>Women and Armed Conflict. </i>Although the threat of global conflict has been reduced, wars of aggression, colonial or other forms of alien domination and foreign occupation, civil wars, and terrorism continue to plague the world. Grave violations of the human rights of women occur, particularly in times of armed conflict, and include murder, torture, systematic rape, forced pregnancy and forced abortion, in particular under policies of ethnic cleansing. Women and girls are among those most affected by the violence and economic instability associated with armed conflict Yet, when it comes to negotiating peace and facilitating the reconstruction of societies after war, women are grossly under- represented. For example, no Bosnian women were present at the Dayton Peace negotiations in 1995. With Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, peace and security (2000), the United Nations has affirmed that women's protection in armed conflict and the integration of women's voices and experiences in the process of building peace are a primary concern of the international community.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;</b><strike> Development Programs. National and international development programs now often stress the need to &ldquo;integrate&rdquo; women into the development process. Full recognition is seldom given to the contributions women already make to economic and social progress. For example, women make up 60-80 percent of the agricultural workers of the world; in some parts of Africa, women manage one third of the farms. Yet few programs of agricultural development seek to upgrade the skills of women, provide easier access to credit, assure them the right to land titles in their own names, and so forth. In some cases, modernization actually degrades the already low status of women. <br> <i></strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">III<font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> </i>Across the... <br> (1) to exert.... <b>We need to recognize that this measure has become a symbol of the drive for equality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>It has meaning far beyond the borders of one nation in the search for equal rights in other societies; <br> (2) to urge governments to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, <strike> which was adopted by the United Nations in December 1979;<b></strike>&nbsp;(CEDAW) as well as the Optional Protocol to CEDAW adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 October 1999, which gives women the right to seek redress for violations of their human rights, including gender-based violence;</b><strike> <br> </strike> (3) to encourage...&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> (4) <strike> to examine governmental policies and practices, including development assistance, as to their impact on women&rsquo;s lives; to work to ensure that policies upgrade the status of women and that women are included in decision-making regarding development goals and programs. The key roles of women as workers and consumers and as transmitters of culture must be given adequate weight in national development activities; <br> </font></b></b><b></strike><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >to urge governments to ratify the Statute of the International Criminal Court, adopted in June 1998, which specifically addresses gender-based crimes and crimes against humanity such as rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy and enforced sterilization; <br> </font></b></b></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(5) <strike> to examine the impact of transnational corporations on women&rsquo;s lives, and to work to eradicate exploitative practices where identified. One such area is the promotion and selling of inappropriate products and technologies; <br> <b></strike> to support the need to enact specific legislation and develop policies to strengthen women's executive and professional abilities, in particular to allow them to manage their own businesses. To this end, governments should develop policies and projects that use local, national and international networks to facilitate information, technology, credit and training for women entrepreneurs, as well as programs that aim to enhance women's education; <br> </font></b><strike><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(4)</strike>&nbsp; <b>(6)</b> to examine governmental policies and practices,.... <br> <strike> (5)</strike>&nbsp; <b>(7)</b> to examine the impact of transnational corporations.... <br> </font></strike></strike><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(8) to encourage steps that promote legal literacy by publicizing and disseminating information on laws relating to the equal rights of men and women; <br> </b><strike> (6) </strike>&nbsp; <b>(9) </b>to encourage private charitable organizations, including churches, to initiate and support more programs of leadership education for women and other educational programs that upgrade the status of women; <br> </font></b></b><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >In many parts of the world, illiteracy remains high among adult women because of the lack of access to education in childhood.
