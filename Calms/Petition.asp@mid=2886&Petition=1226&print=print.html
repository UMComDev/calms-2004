<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Amend �� 2535-2542 as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> � <b>2535</b>.<i>Unincorporated Local Church Property--Title and Purchase-- </i>Unless otherwise required by local law (� 2506), title to all property now owned or hereafter acquired by an unincorporated local church, and any organization, board, commission, society, or similar body connected therewith, shall be held by and/or conveyed and transferred to its duly elected trustees, their successors and assigns, in trust for the use and benefit of such local church and of The United Methodist Church. The trustees shall be named as the board of trustees of the local church in the written instrument conveying or transferring title. Every instrument of conveyance of real estate shall contain the appropriate trust clause as set forth in the <i>Discipline </i>(�2503). <b>The only exception to this requirement is when property is designated by the district superintendent as gift property under the provision of � 2536.2 and � 2536.3. <br> </font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >� <b>2536.</b> <i>Unincorporated Local Church Property</i>-<i>Notice and Authorization</i>- <b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Prior to the purchase by an unincorporated local church of any real estate, a resolution authorizing such action shall be passed at a meeting of the charge conference by a majority vote of its members present and voting at a regular meeting or a special meeting of the charge conference called for that purpose; provided, however, that not less than ten days&rsquo; notice of such meeting and the proposed action shall have been given from the pulpit or in the weekly bulletin of the church; and provided further, that written consent to such action shall be given by the pastor and the district superintendent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> (See �2543.) <br> <b> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;When real estate is being donated to an unincorporated local church only as a gift to be sold for the purpose of providing assets or income for the church to use in its ministry and mission, the board of trustees of the unincorporated local church may petition the district superintendent to declare such property as gift property, a contribution of assets for mission and ministry. The receipt or sale of gift property may be transacted by the Board of Trustees of the local church without charge conference action provided that a statement from the district superintendent determining the said property as gift property shall be entered into the charge conference minutes at its next meeting. Written consent to such action shall be given by both the pastor and the district superintendent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a district superintendent receives a request from the Board of Trustees of a local church to designate a contribution of real estate as gift property, and thus to be exempt from the usual requirements of � 2536.1, it shall be his or her responsibility to assure that the contribution to be so designated shall conform to guidelines established by the General Council on Finance and Administration as to criteria for property to be designated gift property as distinguished from property for mission and ministry of the local church. Gift property shall not be subject to the requirements of entering the trust clause into the deed or instrument of conveyance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b>�<b> 2537. </b><i>Incorporated Local Church Property</i>-<i>Title and Purchase</i>-Unless otherwise required by local law (� 2506), the title to all property now owned or hereafter acquired by an incorporated local church, and any organization, board, commission, society, or similar body connected therewith, shall be held by and/or conveyed to the corporate body in its corporate name, in trust for the use and benefit of such local church and of The United Methodist Church. Every instrument of conveyance of real estate shall contain the appropriate trust clause as set forth in the <i>Discipline</i> (� 2503).&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gift property donated to an incorporated local church under the provisions of � 2536.2 and � 2536.3 shall be exempt from this requirement. <br> </b>�<b> 2538.</b> <i>Incorporated Local Church Property</i>-<i>Notice and Authorization</i>-Prior to the purchase by a local church corporation of any real estate, a resolution authorizing such action shall be passed by the charge conference in corporate session, or such other corporate body as the local laws may require, with the members thereof acting in their capacity as members of the corporate body, by a majority vote of those present and voting at any regular or special meeting called for that purpose; <i>provided</i> that not less than ten days&rsquo; notice of such meeting and the proposed action shall have been given from the pulpit or in the weekly bulletin of the local church; and <i>provided</i> further, that written consent to such action shall be given by the pastor and the district superintendent; and <i>provided</i> further, that all such transactions shall have the approval of the charge conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The exception to this requirement is only if the property is determined to be gift property to be disposed of for the purpose of realizing the assets and income for other church purposes as provided for in � 2536.2 and � 2536.3. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2539.</b> <i>Unincorporated Local Church Property</i>-<i>Sale, Transfer, Lease, or Mortgage</i>-Any real property owned by or in which an unincorporated local church has any interest may be sold, transferred, leased for a term of thirty days or more (which shall include leases for less than thirty days if such a lease is consecutive with the same lessee), or mortgaged subject to the following procedure and conditions: <br> 1.

The written consent of the pastor of the local church and the district superintendent to the proposed action shall be necessary and shall be affixed to or included in the instrument of sale, conveyance, transfer, lease, or mortgage.

The district strategies or other missional strategies should include the ministries of both United Methodist congregations and the community where the existing facility is located.</strike>&nbsp;Certification by the district superintendent shall be conclusive evidence that the transfer or encumbrance conforms to the <i>Discipline</i>.

The resolution authorizing such proposed action .... <br> 5. The board of directors at any regular or special meeting shall take such action and adopt such resolutions as may be necessary or required by the local laws. <br> 6.
