<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The world&rsquo;s nations and peoples are all parts of the rich mosaic of God&rsquo;s creation. They are called to reverence God&rsquo;s sovereignty and affirm and protect the dignity with which each member of the human family has been bestowed. The treaties and conventions entered into and forged between and among nations in the world are a response, albeit too human, to God&rsquo;s call for nations to live in peace and harmony with each other-with none making one afraid of the other (Micah 4:4) and with justice the only criterion by which we shall judge the neighbor (Leviticus 19:15). With treaties and conventions and the affirmations and obligations arising from them, nations and peoples are admonished to neither lift up sword against another nor learn war any longer (Micah 4:3). <br> Jesus, in his actions, stories and parables, repeatedly affirmed those who were considered the least important and declared them the most important: a child, a blind man, a fisherman, a Samaritan, a sinner, a woman, or a lost brother. Often the one Jesus affirmed was the one society considered the most dispensable. Jesus affirmed the faith, resources and ethics of these powerless unknowns. Paul continued this tradition when he validated an ethic of equality and mutuality where each part of the body was imperatively important to the whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The treaties and conventions entered into and forged by nations-big and small, developed and developing-especially those negotiated within the aegis of the United Nations, are a call to governments to recognize and affirm through legal norms the place, worth and contribution of every member of the human family and the community of nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The 2000 General Conference committed the &ldquo;The United Methodist Church [to] participate in building communities that prioritize the eradication of poverty and the elimination of hunger; the ending of wars and the resolution of conflicts; and the overcoming of ignorance, curing of diseases, and healing of enmities. The United Nations remains the single most important international institution to achieve these ends. The United Methodist Church must continue to support the United Nations<i>.&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In a time where communications, transportation and technology have made nation- state boundaries increasingly porous, it is essential that the international community come to fair and just agreements within an inclusive, multilateral and democratic process about many issues, including the environment, refugees, migration, unemployment, HIV/AIDS, gender equality, child labor, drug trafficking, migrant workers, labor, international crime, disarmament and terrorism, as well as international peace and common security.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Sovereign nations need to have a place and forum for agreements and disagreements to be commonly discussed and addressed. International treaty making allows for both national and international legislation processes to interface so as to ensure just, peaceable and sustainable relations among nations. The United Nations provides one of the best forums for these processes to evolve and develop the necessary legal norms that govern the relations and affairs of nations and peoples. Multilateralism is giving voice to every nation; it is in the national interest of every nation to cooperate multilaterally.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> It is in this spirit that we urge all nations, especially the United States, to review their record of signing and ratifying international agreements, treaties and conventions. As a vital leader in the gestation and foundation of the United Nations, the United States has had a long history of leadership in the development of the agenda of the United Nations and in the creation of its conventions, treaties and protocols. The enormous influence the United States wields at the United Nations and in the international community puts on it also an enormous responsibility and obligation. <br> Therefore, we urge United Methodists to advocate and campaign for the ratification of these agreements worldwide but especially the following in the United States. <br> The following Treaties and Conventions have been signed by the U.S. President but have not been ratified by the U.S. Senate; it is crucial that the Senate act promptly to give its &ldquo;advice and consent&rdquo; to the ratification of the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Women: <br> </font></b></b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2" ></li></li><b><font FACE="Times New Roman">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
