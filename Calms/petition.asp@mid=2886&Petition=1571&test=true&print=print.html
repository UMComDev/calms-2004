<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Report No. 7 <br> <font SIZE="4">INTERDENOMINATIONAL COOPERATION FUND <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b></b><b></CENTER></b><font SIZE="2" FACE="Times New Roman" ><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <font SIZE="3"><br> The Interdenominational Cooperation Fund provides basic support for ecumenical agencies through which The United Methodist Church participates in God's mission in cooperation with other Christian communions. The General Council on Finance and Administration (GCFA) recommends the spending plan to the General Conference after considering recommendations developed by the General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious Concerns (GCCUIC), in consultation with the Council of Bishops (�818.1). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> GCFA attempted to keep the increases of the Interdenominational Cooperation Fund to a minimum in light of the financial situation across the connection. The increase in the quadrennial budget for 2005-2008 is less than 2%. When compared to the 2001-2004 budget, the increase in the Interdenominational Cooperation Fund budget is significantly lower than the 8% increase over the prior quadrennium. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> General agencies may participate in the budgets of the cognate divisions and departments of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A., the World Council of Churches, the World Methodist Council and other interdenominational ecumenical activities. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Explanation of Items in the Budget&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>Interpretation Resources </b></i>(�1806.11-.13). United Methodist Communications is allocated the designated sum for the cost of resources in promoting the Interdenominational Cooperation Fund. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>General Council on Finance and Administration</b></i>. The Council reports to and is amenable to the General Conference and is responsible for receiving and distributing general church funds. A portion of the Council&rsquo;s expenses is charged to the Interdenominational Cooperation Fund as provided in �805.6a and Report No. 14. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>National Councils of Churches/Regional Ecumenical Organizations</b></i>. This category includes funds to support the work of councils or organizations whose membership is limited to a specific country or geographic region. Among the specific organizations receiving support is the <b><i>National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A</b>. </i>This council comprises thirty-six member denominations and communions in the United States representing fifty-two million Christians.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>World Councils of Churches/International Ecumenical Organizations</b></i>. This category includes funds to support the work of councils or organizations whose membership is not limited to a specific country or geographic region. <b><i>The World Council of Churches</b></i>, founded in 1948, includes 330 member communions throughout the world representing 450 million Christians. Funds in this category provide for United Methodist participation in the basic budget of the Council. Funds are also provided for the United Methodist commitment for costs of the World Council of Churches Assembly, including travel and related expenses for Christians from third world countries. These periodic meetings of the Council are held every seven or eight years. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>Christian World Communions/Methodist Unity</b></i>. This category includes funds to support the work of ecumenical organizations whose members trace their origins to some part of the religious tradition started by John Wesley. <b><i>The World Methodist Council</b></i>, established in 1881, is a significant channel for United Methodist relationships with other Methodist bodies and with autonomous and united churches formerly part of The United Methodist Church or its predecessor denominations. There are presently more than 34 million members in these churches in 108 different countries. The allocation provides for United Methodist participation in the basic budget of the Council. It represents the majority of the funding for the North American section, and for the general administrative and program activity of the entire Council. The World Methodist Council has established a five-year endowment campaign entitled <b><i>Achieving the Vision</b></i> for the purpose of ensuring the ongoing work of the council. This permanent fund will supplement the annual support from the member churches. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>Pan-Methodist Commissions.</b></i> Representatives of The United Methodist Church have been meeting with representatives of The African Methodist Episcopal Church, The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and The Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in two Pan-Methodist commissions for a number of years to deal with areas of mutual interest, including a possible merger. The 2000 General Conference of The United Methodist Church approved the combination of these two commissions into one body called the <b><i>Commission on Pan-Methodist Cooperation and Union</b></i>. There is a possibility that other denominations of the Wesleyan tradition called Methodists in America may wish to join these discussions. These funds provide the United Methodist share of operating expenses for the Commission on Pan-Methodist Cooperation and Union. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>Ecumenical/Multilateral Conversations</b></i>. This line item provides funding for ongoing and proposed meetings with representatives of other denominations. Included in this category is Churches Uniting in Christ (CUIC), formerly known as the Consultation on Church Union. Nine denominations are joined together in CUIC to seek ways toward greater visible unity among them. The CUIC is now working to finalize a covenant among its member churches involving issues such as mutual recognition of each other's churches, members, and clergy, and shared eucharistic fellowship. This allocation provides for United Methodist participation in the basic budget of this organization. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>Ecumenical Representative Travel.</b></i> The travel expenses for United Methodist representatives named in advance by the General Conference, the Council of Bishops, or the GCCUIC are paid from the Interdenominational Cooperation Fund (�818.2). Costs are paid for travel to the General Assembly and, as approved by the general secretary of the GCCUIC, other units of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A.; the Central Committee and other units of the World Council of Churches, including its executive committee and periodic assembly; the Executive Committee of the World Methodist Council; special meetings of the Consultation on Church Union, and the Commission on Pan-Methodist Cooperation and Union, and United Methodist participation in concordat relationships, and other ecumenical activities and bodies. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Expenses are paid in accordance with guidelines adopted by the GCFA and shall be limited to round-trip coach air fare and/or other necessary surface transportation from the place of residence of the representative to the place of the meeting, plus food and lodging expense at the meeting. Attendance during three-fourths of the agenda of a meeting shall be required for reimbursement of meeting expenses. Travel expenses shall be paid when approved by persons designated by the general secretary of the GCCUIC or by the general secretary of the GCFA. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>Interreligious Relations.</b></i> This budget line seeks to provide resources for United Methodist to engage more directly with neighbors of other faith communities. The funds shall be used to provide information, materials and support for dialogues locally and regionally, and to support ecumenical programs involving interfaith partners. Allocations of the funds shall be determined by the GCCUIC. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>Contingency Reserve</b></i>. This allocation for the Interdenominational Cooperation Fund provides for unforeseen or emergency situations that fall within the scope of the fund. It is distributed by the GCFA after receiving recommendations from the GCCUIC. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><CENTER><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >FOR BUDGET INFORMATION SEE ADCA p. 527</font></CENTER><font SIZE="6" FACE="Times New Roman" ><br> <font SIZE="3"><br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
