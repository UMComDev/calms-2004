<font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >Amend �421 as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >� <b>421. <i>Administrative and Ordinary </b>Supervision</i>- <b>In the course of their work with the bishop, two types of&nbsp;&nbsp;supervision are required of district superintendents: <i>Administrative and Ordinary Supervision. Administrative Supervision </i>includes discussion of all matters where a pastor&rsquo;s leadership and performance is being brought into question, whether through written and signed complaint or oral presentations of concern regarding the violation of their sacred trust. These shall all be done in accordance with � 359, particularly in regard to � 359.2. <i>Fair Process in Administrative Hearings</i>. Any clergy may have an elder in full connection who is in good standing, as defined by the Conference Board of Ordained Ministry, present with them for any <i>Administrative </i>or <i>Ordinary Supervisory </i>meeting as an advocate with voice should they so desire. At any supervisory meeting where the bishop and one or more district superintendent is present or where more than one district superintendent is present, the clergyperson may have an advocate present with him or her. The clergyperson must be notified of the meeting with the bishop and one or more district superintendents or with more than one district superintendent a minimum of ten days prior to the meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure on the part of the bishop or district superintendents to fulfill this process of notification and right to advocacy shall result in the right to direct appeal to the Judicial Council by the person whose rights have been violated. Bishops and superintendents found to be in violation of this process shall be required to attend special training for appropriate methods of supervision. This will protect clergy rights and encourage pastoral care for clergy who are damaged by the failure of the bishop and superintendents to follow the appropriate procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordinary Supervision </i>includes the following: <br> </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >1. To work with elders, deacons, local pastors, diaconal ministers, and charge conferences in formulating statements of purpose for congregations in fulfilling their mission and with committees on pastor-parish relations to clarify the priorities for the ministry of clergy and diaconal ministers. <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >2. To establish a clearly understood process of supervision for clergy of the district, including observation of all aspects of ministry, direct evaluation, and feedback to the clergy involved. <b>The bishop, the district superintendents, and the Conference Board of Ordained Ministry shall enter a process to carefully define in writing the process for supervision of clergy used by the district superintendents, so that it is consistent. Further, this process should be established and recorded in the Standing Rules of the annual conference as found in the Official Journal. The Conference Board of Ordained Ministry shall review this process with the bishop and district superintendents on an annual basis to assure that the rights of clergy are being protected, even as the responsibilities of the cabinet are performed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" >3. To consult with committees on pastor-parish relations to update their profiles for appointment in accordance with � 432.1 and with pastors to update their profiles for appointment in accordance with � 432.2.</sub><sup>18</sup></sub><br> 4. To make specific provision for the supervision of probationary members and local pastors appointed within the district. <br> 5. To receive annually from each clergyperson a report of his or her program of continuing education and spiritual growth, to give counsel concerning future plans, and to encourage congregations to give time and financial support for such programs. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
