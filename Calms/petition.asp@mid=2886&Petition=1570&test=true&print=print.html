<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Report No. 6 <br> <font SIZE="4">GENERAL ADMINISTRATION FUND <br> <font SIZE="3"><br> </font></b></b><b></CENTER></b><font SIZE="2" FACE="Times New Roman" ><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <font SIZE="3"><br> The General Administration Fund (�817) finances those general church activities that are specifically administrative as contrasted with programmatic, missional, or ecumenical. Given the current economic climate affecting the amount of financial resources available in our annual conferences, the needs of the agencies funded through World Service, and the needs for significant increased funding for our bishops through the Episcopal Fund, the General Council on Finance and Administration (GCFA) attempted to keep the increases of the General Administration Fund to a minimum. The increase in the quadrennial budgets for 2005-2008 is less than 11%. In order to keep cost increases to a minimum GCFA had to take certain measures as outlined in the explanation of items in the budget. <br> <br> <b> </font><CENTER><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Explanation of Items in the Budget <br> </font></CENTER></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> <b><i>Interpretation Resources</b></i> (�1806.11-.13). United Methodist Communications is allocated the designated sum for the cost of resources used in promoting the General Administration Fund. There is no increase in cost over the prior quadrennium. <br> <br> <b> <i>The General Council on Finance and Administration</b></i> (�805.6). The Council reports to and is amenable to the General Conference and is responsible for receiving and distributing general church funds. A portion of the Council&rsquo;s expenses is charged to the General Administration Fund as provided in&nbsp;&nbsp;�805.6a and Report No. 14. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><b><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >General Conference</b></i> (��501-510). The expense of the General Conference is a major item in the budget. The amount budgeted provides for all administrative costs of the session, including travel and per diem hotel and meal cost of delegates, costs of the offices of the secretary and business manager of the General Conference, expenses of the Commission on the General Conference, and publishing of the <i>Daily Christian Advocate</i>. In order to keep cost increases to a minimum the Council, in consultation with the Business Manager and the Chair of the Commission on the General Conference, reduced the budget submitted by the Commission by $460,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission will inform the General Conference in its report what areas of the budget will be reduced by this amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reserves after all expenses have been processed for the 2004 General Conference are predicted to be in a deficit position of $100,000 or more.&nbsp;&nbsp;With cost reduction measures it is hoped the Commission on the General Conference will be able to turn this deficit into a surplus by the end of the 2008 General Conference. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></b></b></i></i><b><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >The General Commission on Archives and History</b></i> (��1701-1712). The purpose of this commission is to gather, preserve, hold title to, and disseminate materials on the history of The United Methodist Church and its antecedents. The quadrennial increases were kept to approximately 5%. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>Historic Sites and Heritage Landmarks</b></i> (�1712). The supervision of historic sites and heritage landmarks is part of the responsibility assigned to the General Commission on Archives and History, and the funds budgeted for this purpose are administered by the commission. The quadrennial increases were kept to approximately 5%. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>The Judicial Council</b></i> (��2601-2622). The Judicial Council is the highest judicial body in The United Methodist Church. It determines the legality and/or constitutionality of actions by agencies, boards, conferences, and officials of the Church. �817.3 provides that the expenses of the Judicial Council shall be paid from the General Administration Fund, within a budget submitted annually to the GCFA for its approval. These office, meeting, and travel expenses shall be submitted in accordance with the GCFA expense policy guidelines on an expense report accompanied by required supporting documentation. The Judicial Council has made significant reductions in their administrative expenses, such that their budget was reduced by almost 19% over the prior quadrennium. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>The Contingency Reserve</b></i>. This allocation provides funding for unforeseen or emergency situations that fall within the scope of general administration. In prior quadrenniums these funds have been used to cover shortfalls in the budgets of the General Conference, Judicial Council and the General Commission on&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Archives and History. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> FOR BUDGET INFORMATION, SEE ADCA p. 524 <br> </font></b></b></i></i><CENTER><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ></font></CENTER><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
