<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Add new resolution as follows: <br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >WHEREAS, the World Methodist Council has recommended the following be adopted by its member churches: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> People of the Wesleyan heritage look upon the whole world as their parish.&nbsp;&nbsp;They feel committed to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to all people. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Many of the churches in that Methodist tradition are responding anew to the call for mission in the whole world.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are changing patterns of migration and increasing movements of peoples, both geographically and spiritually.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result new Methodist missions are started in areas where there are already communities and churches of the Wesleyan tradition working.&nbsp;&nbsp;In places, this has created confusion and unhealthy competition and has been an offense to the Gospel.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, both clergy and laity seek to move from one church to another. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> It is natural to those who are in the tradition of John Wesley to seek out and respond to new opportunities and to respond to requests for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to stretch out our hand to all whose heart is as our heart and to work closely together.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our instinct is to share as fully as possible with all who share with us in the same mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are therefore committed to support each other in our work and to do nothing that would undermine each other. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In this fluid situation the World Methodist Council finds it necessary for the sake of its common mission to ask its member churches to agree on some principles and guidelines on this matter. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Three basic principles should apply especially to all such Methodist work being done by different member churches in the same area. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Respect <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Courtesy <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Communication and consultation <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Two consequences follow: <br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;When any member churches of the WMC are intending to support and endorse new work in an area of the world, before agreeing officially: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Other member churches should be notified <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >- Advice should be sought in order to minimize, or prevent, any duplication of resources <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware that the needs of people of particular languages or cultures may make new mission work necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the principles of respect, courtesy and communication should ensure that all our traditions can delight in new manifestations of the work of God&rsquo;s spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Spirit often works beyond our own boundaries and limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, whenever possible,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font></i></i></i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> we would encourage those involved in &ldquo;new&rdquo; Methodist movements to link with an existing church.&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe it is possible to order our relationships in a cooperative way and to help new fellowships to seek the most appropriate church to join. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same principle should apply where member churches presently find themselves working alongside each other in various countries: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >- Different Methodist traditions should be encouraged to join together, or at least to work in a spirit of consultation and cooperation. <br> - Different Methodist traditions should communicate fully with each other, and thereby share resources and experience for the furtherance of God&rsquo;s Kingdom. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No member churches should be working in competition with each other, because this implies the breakdown of respect, courtesy, and communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;Good practice would be to develop regular meetings and clear protocols governing the relationship of churches together in particular areas. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The World Methodist Council, through its officers, offers its good services to provide a platform and the channels necessary for information and consultation between its member churches on these matters. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i><font FACE="Times New Roman">Therefore be it resolved </i><font FACE="Times New Roman">that The United Methodist Church adopts these guidelines in its commitment to the pursuit of Christ&rsquo;s call to Christian unity and in a spirit of solidarity with other member churches of the World Methodist Council. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
