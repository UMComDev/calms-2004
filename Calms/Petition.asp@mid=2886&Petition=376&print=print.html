<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >HUMAN RIGHTS IN VIETNAM <br> </b><br> Vietnam is a one-party state governed by the Communist party. The government persecutes its critics, controls all media, curtails religious freedom, and prohibits independent, political, and labor&nbsp;&nbsp;groups. The judicial system is subservient to the party, which tells the courts how to rule in political cases. The government controls the economy, and private property rights are limited. According to international human rights groups such as Amnesty International, there is active persecution of religious groups not sanctioned by the government. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>THE ISSUES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </b><br> <b>Freedom of Speech</b> - All media are forbidden from questioning the authority of the Communist party, criticizing individual government leaders, or questioning the government&rsquo;s human rights record. Journalists who disobey are jailed, placed under house arrest, lose their press cards, or have their publications closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to controversial Web sites is blocked by the government. Indigenous tribes have protested the government&rsquo;s confiscation of their ancestral forest homelands and their lack of religious freedom, including persecution of unauthorized Protestant churches. Many tribal activists were arrested, some receiving sentences of up to 12 years. A &ldquo;democracy group&rdquo; has formed in Vietnam, comprised of former party members, military officers and intellectuals, to organize for democratic reform. Some leaders have been arrested.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Free Elections - </b>The Communist party, through the Fatherland Front, approves all candidates for the National Assembly, 80 percent of whose members belong to the party, and which almost never defies the party. Real governing power is found in the 15-member Politburo of the Communist party. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Political Prisoners - </b>The government has jailed its critics for writing articles and organizing nongovernment approved political activities. Some dissidents have been sentenced to house arrest. There is widespread surveillance by the security services, relying on block wardens in the case of ordinary Vietnamese, but focusing mostly on political and religious dissidents. Prisoners of conscience are detained in very harsh conditions, including shackles, beatings, and torture with electric batons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Religious Freedom - </b>About half of Vietnamese are Buddhist. About ten percent are Christian, mostly Roman Catholic. There are at least 1 million Protestants, most of whom belong to unregistered house churches. All religious groups are supposed to register with the government, which also insists on approval for building churches, operating schools and charities, conventions, seminars, and training of clergy. Mandatory identification papers list religious affiliation. Religious groups often have trouble getting teaching materials, publishing religious texts, and appointing new clergy. All approved religious materials must promote socialism and must be published by a government publisher. Protestants especially have trouble ordaining new clergy. The Cao Daiist (a synthesis of several religions) and Hoa Hao (Buddhist-related) groups also have been especially restricted&nbsp;&nbsp;by the government. Monks and laypeople have been imprisoned for unauthorized charity work. Most clergy must join Communist party-controlled supervisory bodies. Members of religious groups that refuse to join these supervisory bodies, such as the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, are harassed and jailed. Roman Catholics and Protestants who are deemed subversive have also been harassed and detained. Pentecostals have lost employment and had their property confiscated by the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>OUR RESPONSE <br> </b><br> The United Methodist Church calls for the creation and protection of basic human rights and the expansion of democratic liberties in Vietnam. We pray for all Vietnamese, especially for the church in Vietnam. In particular, we pray for full religious freedom, a free press, free elections, equal rule of all for all people, and the abolition of torture. We shall be an advocate for human rights and democratic reforms within Vietnam and in our interactions with the U.S. government and other governments, with ecumenical organizations, and directly with the Vietnamese government, when possible. We stand in solidarity with persecuted persons and human rights advocates in Vietnam.<font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
