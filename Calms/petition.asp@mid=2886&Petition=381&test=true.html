<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >HUMAN RIGHTS IN NORTH KOREA <br> </b><br> The Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea (North Korea) is a one-party state that forbids all political opposition. There are no independent media permitted in North Korea. The economy is controlled by the Korean Workers (Communist) Party. Private property is prohibited. According to international human rights groups, including Amnesty International, political opponents of the regime are imprisoned in labor camps. Reports of torture are common. Religious groups, including churches, outside of the control of the government are forbidden. All travel within the country requires a permit. Permission to leave the country is rare. Kim Jong-il, as general secretary of the Korean Workers Party, is the dictator of North Korea. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>THE ISSUES <br> </b><br> <b>Freedom of Speech</b> - Persons who express any opinion contrary to or critical of the Korean Workers Party are vulnerable to punishment, as are their family members. The news media is government controlled and tightly censored. Access to foreign media is also tightly restricted. Any unauthorized gathering is regarded as a &ldquo;collective disturbance.&rdquo; The government conducts surveillance of every element of society, with an extensive network of informants. School children are encouraged to report to the government any counterrevolutionary activity by their parents. Access to education, employment, and health care can be contingent on the level of loyalty to the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Federation of Trade Unions is the only legal trade union. Strikes and collective bargaining are forbidden. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Free Elections</b> - Elections are held every four years for the Supreme People&rsquo;s Assembly. But all candidates belong either to the ruling party or to state-organized parties. The Assembly only ratifies decisions already made by the Korean Workers Party. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Political Prisoners</b> - Criminal law allows for arbitrary arrests and executions for &ldquo;counterrevolutionary crimes&rdquo; and other acts of political opposition. Crimes can include any criticism of the government or listening to foreign broadcasts. Tens of thousands of political prisoners and their families are reportedly held in &ldquo;reeducation through labor&rdquo; camps. Some political prisoners are held for several years while others are held indefinitely.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Religious Freedom</b> - In 2001 the United Nations Human Rights Committee noted that in North Korea &ldquo;religious practice is repressed or strongly discouraged.&rdquo; Although the constitution guarantees religious liberty, there are commonly reports of imprisonment, torture, and executions aimed at members of religious groups. Many Christians are reportedly held in labor camps, where they face torture and starvation. Open religious practice is restricted to state-sponsored Buddhist and Christian services. The North Korean government estimates there are 10,000 Protestants, 4,000 Catholics, and 10,000 Buddhists. But actual numbers of Christians may number in the hundreds of thousands.&nbsp;&nbsp;Practitioners of Buddhism and native religions may number in the millions. There are two officially sanctioned Protestant churches and one officially sanctioned Catholic church in North Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;The North Korean government says it sanctions 500 house churches. There are approximately 300 Buddhist temples in the country, but religious activity is only permitted at some of them. Persons engaged in evangelism may be arrested. A Protestant seminary has been allowed to open in North Korea, reportedly to train personnel to work with foreign relief organizations. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>OUR RESPONSE <br> </b><br> The United Methodist Church calls for the creation and protection of basic human rights and democratic liberties in North Korea. We pray for all North Koreans, especially for the church in North Korea. In particular, we pray for full religious freedom, a free press, free elections, equal rule of all for all people, and the abolition of torture. We shall be an advocate for human rights and democratic reforms within North Korea in our interactions with the U.S. government and other governments, with ecumenical organizations, and directly with the North Korean government, when possible. We stand in solidarity with all persecuted persons in North Korea.<font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
