<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >Amend Discipline 104 as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >� <b>104. SECTION 4-OUR THEOLOGICAL TASK <br> </font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Theology is our effort to reflect upon God&rsquo;s gracious action ... <br> </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Scripture <br> </font></b></b></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >United Methodists share with other Christians the conviction ... <br> Through this faithful reading of Scripture, we may come to know the truth of the biblical message in its bearing on our own lives and the life of the world. Thus, the Bible serves both as a source of our faith and as the basic criterion by which the truth and fidelity of any interpretation of faith is measured. <br> While we acknowledge the primacy of Scripture in theological reflection, our attempts to grasp its meaning always involve tradition, experience, and reason. Like Scripture, these may become creative vehicles of the Holy Spirit as they function within the Church. They quicken our faith, open our eyes to the wonder of God&rsquo;s love, and clarify our understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>However, this does not mean that Scripture is primary, but elements of tradition, experience, and reason can be combined to outvote and nullify the plain teaching of Scripture.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our doctrine teaches that when Jesus Christ said, "Scripture cannot be broken," this means that "nothing which is written therein can be censured or rejected" (Wesley, Explanatory Notes upon the New Testament, on John 10:35).</b><br> The Wesleyan heritage, reflecting its origins ... <br> The close relationship of tradition, experience, and reason ... <br> The developing communities of faith ... <br> </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Tradition <br> </font></b></b></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The theological task does not start anew ... <br> </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Experience <br> </font></b></b></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >In our theological task, we follow Wesley&rsquo;s practice of examining experience, both individual and corporate, for confirmations of the realities of God&rsquo;s grace attested in Scripture.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman">For Wesley and for us, experience is not the ordinary of the unregenerate or the unbeliever; it is Christian experience, the fruit of the Holy Spirit's guiding the believer's and the Church's reflection on Scripture and the realities of Christian living.&nbsp;&nbsp;Christian experience may illuminate Scripture and alert believers to its various applications, but it will never nullify or supersede the plain teaching of Scripture.</b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> Our experience interacts with Scripture. We read Scripture in light of the conditions and events that help shape who we are, and we interpret our experience in terms of Scripture. <br> All religious experience affects all human experience; all human experience affects our understanding of religious experience. <br> On the personal level, experience is to the individual as tradition is to the church: It is the personal appropriation of God&rsquo;s forgiving and empowering grace. Experience authenticates in our own lives the truths revealed in Scripture and illumined in tradition, enabling us to claim the Christian witness as our own. <br> Wesley described faith and its assurance as &ldquo;a sure trust and confidence&rdquo; in the mercy of God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and a steadfast hope of all good things to be received at God&rsquo;s hand. Such assurance is God&rsquo;s gracious gift through the witness of the Holy Spirit. <br> This &ldquo;new life in Christ&rdquo; is what we as United Methodists mean when we speak of &ldquo;Christian experience.&rdquo; Christian experience gives us new eyes to see the living truth in Scripture. It confirms the biblical message for our present. It illumines our understanding of God and creation and motivates us to make sensitive moral judgments. <br> Although profoundly personal, Christian experience is also corporate; our theological task is informed by the experience of the church and by the common experiences of all humanity. In our attempts to understand the biblical message, we recognize that God&rsquo;s gift of liberating love embraces the whole of creation. <br> Some facets of human experience tax our theological understanding. Many of God&rsquo;s people live in terror, hunger, loneliness, and degradation. Everyday experiences of birth and death, of growth and life in the created world, and an awareness of wider social relations also belong to serious theological reflection. <br> A new awareness of such experiences can inform our appropriation of scriptural truths and sharpen our appreciation of the good news of the kingdom of God. <br> As a source for theological reflection, experience, like tradition, is richly varied, challenging our efforts to put into words the totality of the promises of the gospel. We interpret experience in the light of scriptural norms, just as our experience informs our reading of the biblical message. In this respect, Scripture remains central in our efforts to be faithful in making our Christian witness. <br> </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Reason <br> </font></b></b></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Although we recognize that God&rsquo;s revelation and our experiences of God&rsquo;s grace continually surpass the scope of human language and reason, we also believe that any disciplined theological work calls for the careful use of reason. <br> By reason we read and interpret Scripture. <br> By reason we determine whether our Christian witness is clear. <br> By reason we ask questions of faith and seek to understand God&rsquo;s action and will. <br> By reason we organize the understandings that compose our witness and render them internally coherent. <br> By reason we test the congruence of our witness to the biblical testimony and to the traditions that mediate that testimony to us. <br> By reason we relate our witness to the full range of human knowledge, experience, and service. <br> Since all truth is from God, efforts to discern the connections between revelation and reason, faith and science, grace and nature, are useful endeavors in developing credible and communicable doctrine. We seek nothing less than a total view of reality that is decisively informed by the promises and imperatives of the Christian gospel, though we know well that such an attempt will always be marred by the limits and distortions characteristic of human knowledge. <br> Nevertheless, by our quest for reasoned understandings of Christian faith we seek to grasp, express, and live out the gospel in a way that will commend itself to thoughtful persons who are seeking to know and follow God&rsquo;s ways. <br> In theological reflection, the resources of tradition, experience, and reason are integral to our study of Scripture without displacing Scripture&rsquo;s primacy for faith and practice. These four sources-each making distinctive contributions, yet all finally working together-guide our quest as United Methodists for a vital and appropriate Christian witness. <br> </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The Present Challenge to Theology in the Church <br> </font></b></b></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >In addition to historic tensions and conflicts that still require resolution, new issues continually arise that summon us to fresh theological inquiry. Daily we are presented with an array of concerns that challenge our proclamation of God&rsquo;s reign over all of human existence. <br> Of crucial importance are concerns generated by great human struggles for dignity, liberation, and fulfillment-aspirations that are inherent elements in God&rsquo;s design for creation. These concerns are borne by theologies that express the heart cries of the downtrodden and the aroused indignation of the compassionate. <br> The perils of nuclear destruction, terrorism, war, poverty, violence, and injustice confront us. Injustices linked to race, gender, class, and age are widespread in our times. Misuse of natural resources and disregard for the fragile balances in our environment contradict our calling to care for God&rsquo;s creation. Secularism pervades high-technology civilizations, hindering human awareness of the spiritual depths of existence. <br> We seek an authentic Christian response to these realities that the healing and redeeming work of God might be present in our words and deeds. Too often, theology is used to support practices that are unjust. We look for answers that are in harmony with the gospel and do not claim exemption from critical assessment. <br> A rich quality of our Church, especially as it has developed in the last century, is its global character. We are a Church with a distinctive theological heritage, but that heritage is lived out in a global community, resulting in understandings of our faith enriched by indigenous experiences and manners of expression. <br> We affirm the contributions that United Methodists of varying ethnic, language, cultural, and national groups make to one another and to our Church as a whole. We celebrate our shared commitment to clear theological understanding and vital missional expression. <br> United Methodists as a diverse people continue to strive for consensus in understanding the gospel. In our diversity, we are held together by a shared inheritance and a common desire to participate in the creative and redemptive activity of God.<br> Our task is to articulate our vision in a way that will draw us together as a people in mission. <br> In the name of Jesus Christ we are called to work within our diversity while exercising patience and forbearance with one another. Such patience stems neither from indifference toward truth nor from an indulgent tolerance of error but from an awareness that we know only in part and that none of us is able to search the mysteries of God except by the Spirit of God. We proceed with our theological task, trusting that the Spirit will grant us wisdom to continue our journey with the whole people of God. <br> </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Ecumenical Commitment <br> </font></b></b></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Christian unity is founded on the theological understanding that through faith in Jesus Christ we are made members-in-common of the one body of Christ. Christian unity is not an option; it is a gift to be received and expressed. <br> United Methodists respond to the theological, biblical, and practical mandates for Christian unity by firmly committing ourselves to the cause of Christian unity at local, national, and world levels. We invest ourselves in many ways by which mutual recognition of churches, of members, and of ministries may lead us to sharing in Holy Communion with all of God&rsquo;s people. <br> Knowing that denominational loyalty is always subsumed in our life in the church of Jesus Christ, we welcome and celebrate the rich experience of United Methodist leadership in church councils and consultations, in multilateral and bilateral dialogues, as well as in other forms of ecumenical convergence that have led to the healing of churches and nations. <br> We see the Holy Spirit at work in making the unity among us more visible. <br> Concurrently, we have entered into serious interfaith encounters and explorations between Christians and adherents of other living faiths of the world. Scripture calls us to be both neighbors and witnesses to all peoples. Such encounters require us to reflect anew on our faith and to seek guidance for our witness among neighbors of other faiths. We then rediscover that the God who has acted in Jesus Christ for the salvation of the whole world is also the Creator of all humankind, the One who is &ldquo;above all and through all and in all&rdquo; (Ephesians 4:6). <br> As people bound together on one planet, we see the need for a self-critical view of our own tradition and accurate appreciation of other traditions. In these encounters, our aim is not to reduce doctrinal differences to some lowest common denominator of religious agreement, but to raise all such relationships to the highest possible level of human fellowship and understanding. <br> We labor together with the help of God toward the salvation, health, and peace of all people. In respectful conversations and in practical cooperation, we confess our Christian faith and strive to display the manner in which Jesus Christ is the life and hope of the world. <br> </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Conclusion <br> </font></b></b></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Doctrine arises out of the life of the Church-its faith, its worship, its discipline, its conflicts, its challenges from the world it would serve. <br> Evangelism, nurture, and mission require a constant effort to integrate authentic experience, rational thought, and purposeful action with theological integrity. <br> A convincing witness to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ can contribute to the renewal of our faith, bring persons to that faith, and strengthen the Church as an agent of healing and reconciliation. <br> This witness, however, cannot fully describe or encompass the mystery of God. Though we experience the wonder of God&rsquo;s grace at work with us and among us, and though we know the joy of the present signs of God&rsquo;s kingdom, each new step makes us more aware of the ultimate mystery of God, from which arises a heart of wonder and an attitude of humility. Yet we trust that we can know more fully what is essential for our participation in God&rsquo;s saving work in the world, and we are confident in the ultimate unfolding of God&rsquo;s justice and mercy. <br> In this spirit we take up our theological task. We endeavor through the power of the Holy Spirit to understand the love of God given in Jesus Christ. We seek to spread this love abroad. As we see more clearly who we have been, as we understand more fully the needs of the world, as we draw more effectively upon our theological heritage, we will become better equipped to fulfill our calling as the people of God. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >Now to God <br> who by the power at work within us <br> is able to do far more abundantly <br> than all that we ask or think, <br> to God be glory in the church <br> and in Christ Jesus to all generations, <br> for ever and ever. Amen. <br>  -Ephesians 3:20-21 (based on RSV) <font FACE="Tahoma">
