<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >Amend �306 by adding a new subparagraph 5 which contains the material of footnote 2 as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >� <b>306.</b> <i>Candidacy for Licensed and Ordained Ministry</i>-A person, upon hearing and heeding ... <br> 1. <i>The Inquiring Candidate </i>... <br> 2. <i>The Exploring Candidate</i>-... <br> 3. <i>Declared Candidate for Licensing or Ordination</i>-... <br> 4. <i>The Certified Candidate</i>-... <br> <i>f)</i> agree for the sake of the mission of Jesus Christ in the world and the most effective witness of the gospel, and in consideration of their influence as ministers, to make a complete dedication of _themselves to the highest ideals of the Christian life as set forth in _�� 102-104; 160-166. To this end they shall agree to exercise responsible self-control by personal habits conducive to bodily health, mental and emotional maturity, fidelity in marriage and celibacy in singleness, social responsibility, and growth in grace and the knowledge and love of God.</sub><sup><strike> 2</sup></sub><br> </font><b></strike><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >5. Commentary -</b> <strike> 2. </strike> In adopting the statements in<font FACE="Arial">&nbsp; <font FACE="Times New Roman">�� 304.2 and 306.4<i>f</i> on the moral and social responsibility of ordained ministers, the General Conference seeks to elevate the standards by calling for a more thoroughgoing moral commitment by the candidate and for a more careful and thorough examination of candidates by district committees and boards of the ministry. <br> </font></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The legislation in no way implies that the use of tobacco is a morally indifferent question. In the light of the developing evidence against the use of tobacco, the burden of proof would be upon all users to show that their use of it is consistent with the highest ideals of the Christian life. Similarly, regarding beverage alcohol, the burden of proof would be upon users to show that their action is consistent with the ideals of excellence of mind, purity of body, and responsible social behavior. <br> Therefore, the changes here do not relax the traditional view concerning the use of tobacco and beverage alcohol by ordained ministers in The United Methodist Church. Rather they call for higher standards of self-discipline and habit formation in all personal and social relationships. They call for dimensions of moral commitment that go far beyond any specific practices which might be listed. (<i>See</i> Judicial Council Decision 318.) <br> The General Conference, in response to expressions throughout the Church regarding homosexuality and ordination, reaffirms the present language of the <i>Discipline</i> regarding the character and commitment of persons seeking ordination and affirms its high standards. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than 200 years candidates for ordination have been asked Wesley&rsquo;s Questions, including &ldquo;. . . Have they a clear, sound understanding; right judgment in the things of God; a just conception of salvation by faith? . . .&rdquo; (� 305). <br> All candidates agree to make a complete dedication of themselves to the highest ideals of the Christian life and to this end agree &ldquo;to exercise responsible self-control, by personal habits conducive to bodily health, mental and emotional maturity, fidelity in marriage and celibacy in singleness, social responsibility, and growth in grace and the knowledge and love of God&rdquo; (� 304). <br> The character and commitment of candidates for the ordained ministry is described or examined in six places in the <i>Book of Discipline</i> (�� 304, 305, 306.4, 315, 321, and 326). These say in part: &ldquo;Only those shall be elected to full membership who are of unquestionable moral character and genuine piety, sound in the fundamental doctrines of Christianity and faithful in the discharge of their duties&rdquo; (� 324). <br> The statement on ordination (� 304) states: <i>&rdquo;The Church expects those who seek ordination to make a complete dedication of themselves to the highest ideals of the Christian life . . . [and to] agree to exercise responsible self-control by personal habits. . . .</i>&rdquo;<br> There are eight crucial steps in the examination of candidates. They are: <br> (1) The self-examination of the individual seeking ordination as he or she responds to God&rsquo;s call in personal commitment to Christ and his church. <br> (2) The decision of the committee on pastor-parish relations, which makes the first recommendation to the charge conference when a member seeks to become a candidate for ordained ministry. <br> (3) The decision of the charge conference, which must recommend the candidate. <br> (4) The decision of the district committee on ordained ministry, which must recommend the candidate to the conference board of ordained ministry and, where applicable, the decision of the district conference. <br> (5) The decision of the board of ordained ministry, which must recommend deacon&rsquo;s ordination and probationary membership. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decisions 513, 536, 542. <br> (6) The decision of the clergy members of the annual conference, who must elect candidates to probationary membership. <br> (7) The recommendation of the board of ordained ministry for deacon&rsquo;s or elder&rsquo;s ordination and full membership. <br> (8) The election to deacon&rsquo;s or elder&rsquo;s ordination and full membership by the clergy members of the annual conference. <br> All clergy members of the annual conference are accountable as to character and effectiveness to the annual conference throughout their entire ministry. <br> The General Conference has made it clear in the &ldquo;Doctrinal Standards and Our Theological Task&rdquo; (Part II of the Discipline) that Scripture, tradition, experience, and reason are our guidelines. &ldquo;United Methodists share with other Christians the conviction that Scripture is the primary source and criterion for Christian doctrine.&rdquo;<br> In the Social Principles, the General Conference has said that &ldquo;we do not condone the practice of homosexuality and consider this practice incompatible with Christian teaching.&rdquo; Furthermore, the Principles state that &ldquo;we affirm the sanctity of the marriage covenant that is expressed in love, mutual support, personal commitment, and shared fidelity between a man and a woman. We believe that God&rsquo;s blessing rests upon such marriage, whether or not there are children of the union. We reject social norms that assume different standards for women than for men in marriage.&rdquo; Also, &ldquo;we affirm the integrity of single persons, and we reject all social practices that discriminate or social attitudes that are prejudicial against persons because they are single.&rdquo;<br> The General Conference affirms the wisdom of our heritage expressed in the disciplinary provisions relating to the character and commitment of ordained ministers. The United Methodist Church has moved away from prohibitions of specific acts, for such prohibitions can be endless. We affirm our trust in the covenant community and the process by which we ordain ministers. <br> In our covenant we are called to trust one another as we recommend, examine, and elect candidates for the ordained ministry and conference membership. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decision 480. <br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
