United Methodists have long been known for an open communion table-communion which is open to all Christians who profess faith in Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our open table, and our belief that faith shapes our daily life and social world, some suggest that United Methodists have no beliefs others say we are only interested in social work.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the contrary, we believe our lives and worship should demonstrate the openness that Jesus showed people on the edges of religion and society like Samaritans, women, sinners, and the sick.&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the book of Acts and the letters of Paul, and James, faith must be put into action.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our salvation in Jesus Christ is the source of our beliefs and practices. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Study Document for United Methodists" is based on official and historic Wesleyan and United Methodist documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the Study Document is to help members clarify United Methodist beliefs and practices in a time when critics attack our bishops and national agencies as being outside "classical" or "orthodox" Christianity.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Wesley, we will not debate who is the most orthodox of them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;We join Wesley and say, if your heart is like mine, take my hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are alive to share the love of God and to serve our neighbor.&nbsp;&nbsp; This Study Document is designed to include rather than exclude, to affirm rather than persecute.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a tradition of which we can be proud.&nbsp;&nbsp;We United Methodists leave the door open and the light on.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are welcome at the table.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is a home from which to love God and serve your neighbor. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All United Methodists are called to be and invite others to be disciples of Jesus Christ who taught us to: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love God with all our hearts and minds; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love our neighbor as ourselves; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serve &ldquo;the least of these&rdquo; as if they were Christ; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serve God rather than money; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray for God&rsquo;s will to be done &ldquo;on Earth as it is in Heaven&rdquo;; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Believe that Jesus offers salvation; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgive and be forgiven; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust God in all things; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be empowered and comforted by the Holy Spirit. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicate the good news of Jesus Christ. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All United Methodists are called to be Christians of the Wesleyan heritage which means to participate in works of piety such as: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayer-both private and corporate <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public Worship-community allows for accountability and mutual help <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bible Study-Scripture is &ldquo;sufficient for salvation&rdquo;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fasting-John Wesley fasted one day per week <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communion-weekly if possible <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christian Conferencing-meeting together at all levels of the church to exhort each other to faithfulness, organize for effective ministries, and designate the use of resources to communicate the message of Jesus. <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To participate in works of mercy, or &ldquo;doing good&rdquo; to your neighbor.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are actions in line with Jesus&rsquo; teachings and are similar to John Wesley&rsquo;s works: <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >Examples of Wesley&rsquo;s Day: <br></font><font FACE="Wingdings" SIZE="3" >�&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial">Allowing women to &ldquo;exhort&rdquo;

The United Methodist Church affirms and emulates John Wesley&rsquo;s commitment &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to studying historic church writings, creeds, histories and theologies as sources for guidance and insight into Christianity. <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Methodist Church affirms the &ldquo;quadrilateral&rsquo; of scripture, tradition, reason, and experience as authoritative sources for our theological task.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first three categories of scripture, tradition and reason were basic to the Church of England teachings as developed by Thomas Hooker in the late 16</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;Century.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wesley&rsquo;s emphasis on conversion and practical application of faith are the foundation of the fourth category of experience. &ldquo;Wesley believed that the living core of Christian faith was revealed in scripture, illumined by tradition, vivified in personal experience, and confirmed by reason.&rdquo; (� 104, p.77) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Methodist Church rigorously defends the Wesleyan tradition of not requiring adherence to, or confession of creeds or doctrines as a test for membership or for being a Christian; we confirm the only requirement is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; profession of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Methodist Church affirms John Wesley&rsquo;s stance that the Bible is sufficient for salvation and is the only book which holds salvation for Christians.&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with Wesley that Scripture interprets Scripture and like Wesley, we are compelled not to follow those biblical teachings that fail the tests of prophetic standards of justice, the teachings of Jesus, and centrality to salvation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because prophets condemned unjust social structures, because Jesus broke dehumanizing social and religious barriers, and because Wesley adamantly rejected slavery and promoted the leadership of women, biblical mandates, such as for slaves to obey masters and women to be subordinate to men, are not inherent to the Gospel. <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Methodist Church affirms the role of the Holy Spirit in continuing to reveal spiritual insights in Scripture and provide practical daily guidance through prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wesley's heart warming experience reminds us that the Holy Spirit converts and perfects our lives if we are open so we can love God and serve our neighbor.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Spirit hovered over the first creation, and still groans within us, longing to save the entire creation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Rom 8:22) <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Methodist Church affirms the missionary mandate expressed by John Wesley, to spread scriptural holiness throughout the land, and affirms the global nature of sharing the gospel when Wesley exclaimed, &ldquo;the world is my parish.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an era when Christians live throughout the world, we affirm that mission is from everywhere to everywhere and must relate to each unique context without confusing cultural practices with the gospel.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, unjust cultural, political and economic practices must not be ignored simply because they are part of our own context, or because we fear accusations of cultural imperialism or cultural insensitivity. <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Methodist Church affirms the connectional system, which offers opportunities for Christian conferencing, election of representatives, organizational accountability, setting of official church policy, and assignment of particular ministries to official agencies of the denomination.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Methodist Church affirms the process of democratically electing delegates to serve at Annual Conference, Jurisdictional Conference and General Conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Bishops serve the whole church and do not just represent their home conference, we affirm the election of bishops through Jurisdictional Conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Methodist Church affirms the right of members and leaders with minority opinions in the denomination to maintain their membership and full &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; participation in the life of the denomination. Ordained, commissioned consecrated and elected leadership may hold and express their own opinions but are expected to implement the official policies of the General Conference. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Methodist Church affirms Wesley&rsquo;s exhortation to early Methodists to &ldquo;earn all you can, save all you can, and give all you can&rdquo; in respect to individual and congregational stewardship of resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;Congregations are encouraged to meet apportionments and look for additional ways to give to their local community ministries as well as to emergency needs through UMCOR, special giving through the &ldquo;Advance,&rdquo; using the five-channels of giving by members of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United Methodist Women, and giving to United Methodist Men. <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Methodist Church affirms membership requirements as renouncing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evil, confessing Jesus, receiving scriptural faith, and participating in the life of the church.&nbsp;&nbsp;All baptized Christians are called to ministry in the universal church.&nbsp;&nbsp;All general secretaries, deputy general secretaries, associate general secretaries, and assistant general secretaries shall be members of The United Methodist &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Church. (� 216-�220 and �714, 6) <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Methodist Church affirms that the ministry of all members and the mission of the church is to make disciples of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;Disciple making occurs when we invite people outside the faith to open their hearts to the forgiveness and teachings of Jesus as their Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp; Disciple making also occurs when we inspire and guide Christians to live the teachings of Jesus. <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Methodist Church affirms the open communion table that requires no allegiance to creeds or particular doctrine, only allegiance to Jesus Christ as savior. <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Methodist Church affirms participation in ecumenical organizations such as the National Council of Churches of Christ, the World Council of Churches, the World Methodist Federation, and COCU (Consultation on Church Union) with the goal of reflecting the oneness of Christ&rsquo;s church in the human community and building relationships between faith communities and to further dialogue with persons of other faiths, cultures, and ideologies. (�1902 1. 2.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, United Methodist believe that all have sinned and fallen short of God&rsquo;s will and that it is God grace through searching us out and inviting us to salvation; through the saving forgiveness of our sins when we confess them to God, and through the perfecting work of the Holy Spirit. <br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> PRAYER <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> May your grace, oh God, call us onward to perfect lives of constant service, dedicated study, passionate prayer, joyful worship, and oneness in Christ&rsquo;s body.&nbsp;&nbsp;May we, with Mary, announce the good news that the proud are scattered, the powerful are brought low, the lowly are lifted up, the hungry are filled, and the rich sent away empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;May we, with Jesus our Lord, bring good news to the poor, release to the captives, recovery of sight to the blind, and freedom to the oppressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;May your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.&nbsp;&nbsp;As disciples of Jesus, lovers of God and vessels of the Holy Spirit, we pray all these things.&nbsp;&nbsp;AMEN! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><CENTER><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >Guide for the <br> "Study Document for United Methodists: <br> Traditional Beliefs of United Methodists" <br> </font></CENTER><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> Welcome! This guide begins with 300 years of Methodism to grasp who we are and what we believe as a denomination. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist movement in England was born 300 years ago, June 28, 1703.&nbsp;&nbsp;The world he was born into was as fraught with religious controversy as our own.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all of Europe conflicts between the Protestants and Roman Catholics had been in full swing since the 1500's.&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther posted his "95 Theses" in 1517 and Henry the VIII confiscated all the church buildings and clergy in England in 1534 to create the Church of England and placed himself at its head.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1536, Calvin set up a theocracy in Geneva, Switzerland, England based on a rigid dogma of predestination.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the 1600's in England, the Calvinist Puritans were bound and determined to rid England of any residue of Catholicism and the Anglican Church was their primary target. Puritans were at the forefront of the overthrow of the monarchy and the beheading of King Charles I, who went to his death with disconcerting dignity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament ruled England and after a decade of chaos, parliament begged Charles II to come back and be King. Conflict continued but laws of tolerance allowed "non-conformist" religions to exist under strict rules on meeting places and clergy.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Non-conformists" lost most rights.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> John Wesley's parents had non-conformist family backgrounds but had chosen to be part of the Church of England.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wesley was born into the Church of England, trained by his mother's strict religious training, and undoubtedly shaped by the imprisonment of his debtor father who was a priest in a poor, remote parish.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John and his brother Charles began Methodism at Oxford and began a lifetime of ministries to the poor, prisoners, miners, orphans, women, and others on the margins of English society.&nbsp;&nbsp;He called for repentance from gin distillers who exploited the poor and he excoriated the practice of slavery.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wesley was instrumental in compelling Parliament member, William Wilberforce, to take the lead in making slavery illegal in England. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wesley is famous for his religion of the heart begun at Aldersgate when he felt his heart "strangely warmed" yet, Wesley looked askance at uncontrolled religious emotionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was interested in lives lived in the service of God and neighbor and prioritized a practically applied religion rather than adherence to dogma.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his sermon on "Catholic Spirit" he urged believers to not let differences in belief to divide Christians.&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "In essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, and in all things charity." <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, Wesley was an erudite preacher as well as an avid Biblical and ecclesial scholar.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was a person of "one book," the Bible, he published many volumes of wide ranging classic literature for Methodist leaders and was an advocate of education.&nbsp;&nbsp;He lived to be more than ninety years old, funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to ministries with the poor, and died with enough money to his name to be buried.&nbsp;&nbsp;He lived what he preached and preached what he lived. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the United Methodist family struggles to be true to the call of Christ to love God and neighbor in light of Wesley's leadership to apply "practical" Christianity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some contend that United Methodist leaders have lost sight of the teachings of Christianity and are not within "orthodox," "classical" Christian teachings.&nbsp;&nbsp;They point to the Apostle's creed and make such beliefs as the virgin birth a criterion for orthodoxy and ask for the expunging of non-orthodox leaders in the church.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conflict among Christians has been part of our reality ever since the disciples argued who would sit at the right hand of Jesus or when Peter and Paul argued about circumcision.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conflict can help us sort out our beliefs and work as a community to be faithful to God.&nbsp;&nbsp;It can also undermine our congregations and so focus our energies on right belief that we forget about our neighbor.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" >Since United Methodism emphasizes faith applied to life rather than doctrines, many do not know what we believe or why we are so open to differences of opinions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying Guide is designed to help individuals or groups think through their own backgrounds and identify key beliefs of United Methodists based on our official doctrinal and theological documents found in The United Methodist Book of Discipline.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" ><br> For further background on early Protestant history, go to: <br> http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761555703 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> For a print source on the English context, see Richard P.
