</font><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Report No. 12 <br> <font SIZE="4">PAY EQUITY IN THE GENERAL AGENCIES OF <br> THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH <br> </font></b></b></CENTER></b><font SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman" ><br> <b><i>Executive Summary.</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The 1988 General Conference directed the General Council on Finance and Administration (GCFA) to &ldquo;evaluate internal wage structures and practices of general agencies in light of the principle of pay equity and to include this assessment in its regular monitoring of equal employment opportunity compliance&rdquo; (<i>The Book of Resolutions</i> <i>1996</i>, page 471; also see�� 807.11.<i>b</i>) and 811.1 in <i>The Book of Discipline 2000</i>). In 2000 the GCFA provided a report on its work in compliance with the 1988 directive and its <i>Disciplinary </i>responsibility under �807.11.<i>b</i>)(4) of the <i>Discipline</i>. That report described the difficulties that were encountered, primarily because of a lack of uniformity in the human resource systems and processes among the general agencies (such as job descriptions, job evaluations, salary administration, and the like), and the lack of completeness in existing information in personnel files, especially for long-term employees. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> Since pay equity begins with a solid salary administration program, based on current industry standards, the GCFA recommended the development of new and uniform salary administration systems in the general agencies (cross-agency job evaluation system, job classification/description system, performance appraisal system, salary administration procedures, and pay equity monitoring program). These new systems were anticipated to enhance the work of the general agencies in several respects: make meaningful pay equity analysis, monitoring, and correction possible; bring general agency salary administration systems into compliance with industry standards; make annual performance evaluations more objective and uniform; make possible more accurate and uniform job classifications, which will lead to more consistent salary structures; and provide assurance to general agency employees that they are being paid fairly. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> This report describes the work that has been done on the development and implementation of these new uniform salary administration systems for the general agencies receiving general Church funds. It also describes a procedure that has been developed in consultation with the United Methodist Publishing House and the General Board of Pension and Health Benefits to enable them to report on the achievement of pay equity in their respective general agencies. Implementation of these new systems and procedures will enable the generation of a report to the 2008 General Conference on the results of the pay equity monitoring process in the general agencies of The United Methodist Church. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>The Assignment <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </b>At the 1988 General Conference, the General Board of Global Ministries and the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women jointly submitted a report to the General Conference on pay equity in the United States. That report included a resolution, which was adopted by the General Conference, directing the GCFA to &ldquo;evaluate internal wage structures and practices of general agencies in light of the principle of pay equity, and to include this assessment in its regular monitoring of equal employment opportunity compliance&rdquo; (see <i>The Book of Resolutions 1996</i>, page 471 and ��807.11.<i>b</i>) and 811.1 in <i>The Book of Discipline 2000</i>). The thoughtful report included a biblical and theological framework that the GCFA continues to lift up in regard to these issues: &ldquo;Our biblical faith affirms the inherent value and equal worth in God&rsquo;s sight of every person; it requires the faithful to be advocates for those who have suffered oppression and discrimination. . . . United Methodists have tried to be faithful to this mandate to protect the powerless and to restore the oppressed to their rightful place of dignity and equality . . . . Taking these commitments and responsibilities seriously leads us to embrace the concept of pay equity.&rdquo; (See Luke 4:16-19, Lev. 25:10-17, I Timothy 5:18. See also the Social Principles, at �66, and the 1984 General Conference resolution on the &ldquo;Equal Rights of Women.&rdquo;). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Initial efforts to accomplish this task were not very successful. Significant difficulties were encountered, primarily because of a lack of uniformity in the human resource systems and processes among the general agencies (such as job descriptions, job evaluations, salary administration, and the like), and the lack of completeness in existing information in personnel files, especially for long-term employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those results were reported to the 2000 General Conference, with recommendations on the steps needed to develop and implement an effective pay equity monitoring system.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The 2000 General Conference resolved that this evaluation and monitoring process during the 2001-2004 quadrennium should include, but not be limited to, the development of: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a uniform cross-agency job evaluation system that results in a common database for obtaining information,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a uniform cross-agency job classification/description system that results in a common database for obtaining information, <br> c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a uniform cross-agency performance appraisal system, which would facilitate the evaluation of job performance on an ongoing basis, provide a common database of information about job performance, and reduce the opportunity for bias based on gender or ethnic status,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uniform cross-agency salary administration procedures designed to reduce the opportunity for bias based on gender or ethnic status, and <br> e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an ongoing pay equity monitoring program using these new systems and processes. <br> </font></ul></ul></ul></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> These new systems and processes were to apply to all staff, exempt and non-exempt, at all general agencies receiving general Church funds. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> <b>Background: Carrying Out The Assignment <br> </b><br> The GCFA, through its Executive Committee, assigned the leadership of this development task to a core team of GCFA council members and staff, along with outside consultants. The firm of Gallagher Benefits Services (GBS) was selected to provide consulting services because of their willingness to work with the general agencies to develop specific, unique systems and procedures that recognize the complex nature of the structure of The United Methodist Church and its general agencies. The Pay Equity Task Group (Task Group), an interagency group of staff that had responsibility for human resource issues in their various general agencies, was formed to provide input to the development process.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> GBS consultants conducted a series of meetings, interviews, and employee surveys in each of the twelve general agencies receiving general Church funds to gather an initial perspective on the attitudes and issues surrounding the broad area of pay equity in those agencies. The results of this information gathering process were shared at a joint meeting of the Task Group and the Committee on Personnel Policies and Practices. That combined group used those findings to identify the critical elements or factors related to the work of all of the agencies that needed to be reflected in job descriptions. The Task Group used the elements and factors identified in that meeting to develop two standardized questionnaires that could be used, one by employees and one by supervisors, to describe the important aspects of each particular job. The Human Resources (HR) personnel in the respective general agencies then used these two questionnaires to develop job descriptions in a standardized, summary format for each unique position that could be used by the GBS consultants for comparison within and across the general agencies. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In conjunction with the development of these job descriptions, the Task Group identified the critical factors that needed to be reflected in the ranking of the various jobs within and across agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Descriptive language was developed and the number of different levels for each particular factor or element was identified. After a representative sample of job descriptions was collected from the various agencies and standardized by the GBS consultants, the latter were able to run multiple regression analyses on the information. These analyses were used to determine the degree of correlation of these various elements with salaries in a variety of markets, including general, nonprofit, and religious nonprofit, as well as current salaries in the various agencies. The Task Group and CPPP reviewed these results, and the decision was made to use a blended result from the three market based analyses to determine the maximum weight to assign to each of the various factors. The weighting of each level of each factor was then developed using guidelines generally applied within the HR industry.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> These factor weightings were applied to the standardized job descriptions in each general agency to generate a value for each position. The GBS consultants reviewed the relative rankings of the positions within each respective agency with its HR personnel and senior management. After clarification of any perceived discrepancies, a set of twenty levels was developed to represent the distribution of all of the jobs for exempt and nonexempt staff. These levels will be used in the implementation of the salary administration procedures and in the pay equity monitoring process. It should be noted that not all of the twelve general agencies receiving general Church funds fully participated in all of these steps on a timely basis. The General Board of Global Ministries was significantly delayed in, and has not yet completed, the submission of the standardized job descriptions, in part due to significant transitions in their staffing. The General Council on Ministries has not yet submitted their standardized job descriptions for analysis and review. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Simultaneous with the work on job descriptions and factoring, the Task Group worked on the development of a performance appraisal system. After a review of industry best practices, the group agreed on a system that uses objectives specifically related to the individual employee&rsquo;s job description. The system focuses on performance management by establishing defined procedures for semi-annual and annual discussions by the employee and the supervisor on the setting and achievement of specific goals. These goals can also include goals that are set for the entire agency, or its subunits. There is also a set of key behaviors that the Task Group feels each employee in the general agencies receiving general Church funds needs to display as a part of their job. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The system necessitates that the employee and supervisor develop descriptions of five to eight achievable goals, with definitions of what would meet or exceed those goals, in an initial goal setting session. The employee and supervisor also review the key behaviors to establish a mutual understanding of how an employee can demonstrate understanding and achievement of those behaviors. The semiannual review permits the employee and supervisor to review the initial goals and revise those goals that may have changed due to external factors or revised work priorities. It also is a time to formally review progress to date, and any areas of concern on the part of either employee or supervisor. The entire focus of this system is to encourage and foster a regular exchange of information between the employee and their supervisor so that there are no surprises around the expectations for successful functioning in a particular job. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> One year after the initial goal setting session, and at each annual review thereafter, the supervisor will complete an evaluation of the success of the employee in achieving the goals established for their particular job. These evaluations are done on a five-point scale designed to reflect the degree of achievement in each of the goals or behaviors. The overall results reflect a weighting of 75% on the goals section, and 25% on the behaviors section. For employees that also have supervisory responsibilities, the weighting shifts to 70% and 30% due to inclusion of a specific behavioral element related to leadership skills. The evaluation forms are built with macros so that formulas permit the automatic computation of an overall performance measure. This measure is one of the elements of the pay equity monitoring system that permits the comparison of job relevant factors in compensation. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> The fourth element in this development process is uniform cross-agency salary administration procedures designed to reduce the opportunity for bias based on gender or ethnic status. These procedures are currently being finalized but will define guidelines for hiring rates for placement of new hires within the current salary ranges, and salary increase determinations. Procedures will be established for the periodic review of the salary ranges, with definition of minimum, midpoint, and maximum amounts for each level of the salary scale. A review process will also be included to help maintain the consistency and standardization of job descriptions, factoring, performance appraisals, and salary decisions to support an effective pay equity monitoring process. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> The pay equity monitoring process has not yet been designed, but it will be built on the current salary system. Alternative models for monitoring pay equity and reporting the relevant data are still being considered. The data elements that are necessary for effective monitoring include: Social Security number or other unique identifier, job title, factoring group or classification, annual salary, gender, racial identification, years of service in current position, years of service with agency, education, performance evaluation result, and comparatio. The comparatio is the ratio of an individual&rsquo;s salary to the midpoint for their factoring group or classification. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> At implementation, the monitoring process will involve a comparison of the comparatios for individuals in a given factoring group or classification to observe any differences that cannot be explained by differences in performance evaluation result, relevant experience, or education. If differences remain, they will be reviewed to see if there is any pattern related to gender or ethnicity. The monitoring phase of the process will be implemented after one full cycle of the new performance management process has been completed and the results of the evaluation process are known. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >General Board of Pension and Health Benefits and United Methodist Publishing House <br> </font></b></b></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> The<b> </b>General Board of Pension and Health Benefits (GBOPHB) and the United Methodist Publishing House (UMPH) are two general agencies that do not receive general Church funds. They also do not have representatives on the CPPP. Due to their unique missions on behalf of The United Methodist Church, and due to the distinct marketplaces in which they operate, their personnel and salary administration procedures are established separately by each of those respective agencies. In order to provide reports on the achievement of pay equity within their respective agencies, an alternative monitoring process has been developed. These two agencies will use a commercially available software package to generate reports on pay equity in their respective agencies. The reports will use similar data elements to those anticipated to be used in the process to be developed for the twelve general agencies receiving general Church funds. Their external auditors would review those reports, with the results reported to their respective audit committees. Those audit committees would then report to the GCFA Audit and Review Committee on the achievement of pay equity within each individual agency. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Benefits To Be Gained</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> These are major internal systems changes that are expensive and time consuming to implement. The 2000 General Conference, by its action, confirmed that it is important for Church agencies to live out in their employment and compensation practices the Biblical teachings and United Methodist Social Principles regarding the inherent worth and value of all persons, including equal economic opportunity. The GCFA believes that the implementation of these state of the art compensation systems will improve the economic opportunities for all general agency employees, while at the same time eliminating the potential for pay bias to occur on the basis of inappropriate factors, such as gender and/or ethnic minority status. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> More specifically, the GCFA believes there are significant, tangible benefits associated with the task of assuring that pay equity exists for persons employed by the general agencies of The United Methodist Church. Among those benefits are: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="3" ></li></li></li><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">The confidence that the Church is putting into practice the values which are inherent in our Biblical faith and which have been set forth in our Social Principles; <br> <ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">The establishment of employment and compensation practices which are attuned to both the worth of the individual employee and the human resources needed by the agencies of the Church as they seek to fulfill the missions that have been established for them by the General Conference; <br> </font></li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></li></li><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Human resources and salary administration systems that will assure compliance with legal as well as ethical standards; <br> <ul><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">The efficiency of operation that flows from the ability to attract and retain persons whose skill levels match the responsibilities they are asked to fulfill; </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Annual performance evaluations that will be more objective and uniform, which will make it easier for supervisors to track performance over time and will provide greater assurance that employees will know and understand the objective expectations for their performance; </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">Job classifications that will be more accurate and uniform, which will lead to more consistent salary structures; </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">A higher level of employee morale, based on the knowledge that they are compensated fairly, both in relation to their peers in comparable jobs and in relation to the skills, education, and performance level they bring to their tasks; </li></li><br><li><font FACE="Times New Roman">The legal interests of the general agencies (and thus the denomination) will be better protected by having uniform and updated systems in place that provide for better and more consistent documentation and rationale for salaries, performance appraisals and decisions coming out of those appraisals, and job descriptions that more consistently inform employees of what skills and work are expected of them. <br> </font></li></li></li></li></li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> All systems developed out of this effort will have been designed in such a way that human resources staff, not outside consultants, can perform the pay equity analysis. In other words, the outside consultants have worked with the staff to develop the templates, and human resources staff will train the supervisory staff in the agencies, monitor implementation, provide ongoing supervision of the implementation of the new systems, and do the actual pay equity analysis on a periodic basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Conclusion <br> </b><br> In summary, pay equity in the general agencies of the Church begins with a solid salary administration program, based on current industry standards. This is the foundation for ensuring that pay is fair to all persons working for the general agencies, across the board.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The GCFA believes that this project is a worthy one, in order to carry forward the directive of the General Conference in 1988 that the Church should live out its commitment to the inherent value and equal worth of all people by expecting the general agencies of the Church to model pay equity. Having uniform compensation systems in place will give the general agencies the needed tools to carry out this expectation in the years to come. These new systems will enhance the work of the general agencies in several respects: make meaningful pay equity analysis, monitoring and correction possible; bring general agency salary administration systems into compliance with industry standards; make annual performance evaluations more objective and uniform; make possible more accurate and uniform job classifications that will lead to more consistent salary structures; and provide assurance to general agency employees that they are being paid fairly. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> It should be noted that the principle of &ldquo;pay equity,&rdquo; and the pay monitoring work underlying this report and the 1988 resolution, are not directly related to the salary schedule (minimum, mid-point and maximum salaries) in place at the general agencies receiving general Church funds. The salary schedule for general agencies receiving general Church funds is addressed by the work of the Committee on Personnel Policies and Practices of the GCFA, under �807.11.<i>b</i>)(4) of <i>The Book of</i> <i>Discipline 2000</i>. As noted above, the GBOPHB and the UMPH are exempt from the salary schedule requirements of �807.11.<i>b</i>)(1). <br> </font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >
