<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Human Rights in China <br> </b><br> </font></b></b></CENTER><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >China remains a one-party state that denies basic human rights and democratic liberties to its people. According to international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, tens of thousands of people are detained or imprisoned for exercising their rights of freedom of expression, association, or belief. Freedom of speech is restricted. Free and openly contested elections are uncommon. The Communist party is the only legal party in China. The media is controlled by the government. Trade unions independent of the government and Communist party are not permitted. Religious adherents, including Christians, are legally supposed to belong to state-controlled religious organizations. Members of nonofficially sanctioned religious groups are commonly harassed, as are members of some ethnic minority groups. Atheism is taught in the government schools, and religious instruction for children remains illegal. <br> <br> <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> THE ISSUES: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Freedom of Speech</b> -&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) control or restrict all media, which are not permitted to promote political reform, to report on the internal workings of the government, to criticize Beijing&rsquo;s domestic or international policies, or to report financial data that has not been released by the government. Journalists have been routinely jailed for publishing unauthorized information. The Internet is monitored extremely closely.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> A large government bureaucracy censors the media. All media are expected to conform to CCP Propaganda Department guidelines. All published books must gain approval from the government. Access to foreign media is restricted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Members of the media who do not fully cooperate with the Chinese government or Chinese Communist Party commonly are harassed, detained, threatened, suspended, or dismissed from their jobs. The government owns and operates all television and radio stations.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Free Elections</b> - The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) makes almost all of the key political decisions for China. The Chinese government acts as a rubber stamp for the party. Party membership is required for nearly all high-level positions. Members of the CCP are not supposed to be religious believers. Open elections only take place at the local level for village committees. These boards cannot levy taxes, however, and hold few executive powers. Even here, the CCP dominates, as roughly 60 percent of the members of village committees are CCP members. <br> <br> <b> Political Prisoners</b> - Political prisoners number in the tens of thousands. They include political activists, defenders of human rights, Internet users, and religious dissidents. Even former political prisoners face continued harassment from the police and are often prevented from holding jobs or living undisturbed. Execution for political prisoners is not uncommon China, which executes more people than all other countries combined. According to some estimates, over three-quarters of all executions worldwide occur in China. Executions for both criminals and political prisoners often occur within hours of sentencing.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> More than a million people have been detained without charge under a system of &ldquo;custody and repatriation.&rdquo; Over 300,000 have been detained in labor camps, including migrant workers, vagrants, and homeless children. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Torture and other abuse of prisoners in China are common, even though China signed the United Nations Convention Against Torture in 1988. Guards conduct beatings with electric batons, use rubber truncheons on hands and feet, employ long periods in handcuffs and/or leg irons, often tightened to cause pain, restrict food to starvation levels, and mandate long periods in solitary confinement. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Possibly many thousands of North Korean refugees have been repatriated back to North Korea by China, in contravention of the United Nations Refugee Convention. Tibetan ethnic activists have been sentenced to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Religious Freedom</b> - The Chinese constitution affirms religious toleration but restricts religious practice outside officially recognized organizations. Even though there are five legally recognized religions in China (Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Protestantism, and Catholicism), atheism is taught in schools until the age of 18. eligious instruction for children in China is illegal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The Chinese government estimates there are 200 million religious believers in China. The number of Christians numbers in the tens of millions. The Chinese government claims there are 5 million members of the official Catholic Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vatican believes there are 10 million Catholics in China. The Chinese government reports there are 15 million registered Protestants. But unofficial sources claim there may be 30 to 70 million Protestants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The Chinese government has been particularly harsh with the Falun Gong movement, which has been banned since 1999. Tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners continue to face imprisonment. As many as 500 Falun Gong prisoners have died in custody. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> There are only two Christian organizations with official recognition, one for Protestants (Three-Self Patriotic Movement/Chinese Christian Council) and one for Catholics (Catholic Patriotic Association). The official Catholic group may not openly recognize the authority of the Pope. The message from registered religions is monitored closely and must not be deemed subversive to the Chinese Communist Party. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The Chinese government continues to close unofficial mosques, temples, seminaries, and &ldquo;house churches.&rdquo; Unofficial religious groups are commonly branded as &ldquo;cults.&rdquo; Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns continue to face imprisonment.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> But unofficial religious activity is flourishing in China. Government harassment of unofficial religious groups varies from region to region. In many areas, unofficial religious groups worship largely undisturbed. In others, unregistered worship services are often broken up by zealous officials. Adherents in unofficial religious groups can face fines, detention, beatings, torture, and sometimes death.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Both official and unofficial Christian churches are having difficulty in training adequate numbers of clergy. The government controls official seminaries, but unofficial seminaries do exist. Graduates of official seminaries must be deemed politically reliable and pass a government examination about political knowledge. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> There is also a shortage of religious instructional material for Christians. Thousands of Bibles are printed in China each year but Bibles often cannot be purchased in stores by individuals. Instead, Bibles and other officially sanctioned religious materials are sold in bulk to official religious groups. Members of unofficial religious groups sometimes hesitate to buy Bibles from official groups because the receipts sometimes show the names of purchasers. There is also commonly a shortage of Bibles in rural areas. The smuggling of Bibles and other religious material is still closely monitored by customs officials. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Members of the Chinese military are forbidden from participating in religious activity. <br> <br> <b> Rights of Women</b> - The Chinese constitution claims equality for men and women. But unofficial discrimination is faced in the workforce, where women are much more likely to be laid-off when companies downsize than are men.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Women are also restricted in their reproductive choices and are not supposed to have more than one child. If a woman already has a child, commonly she is forced to have an abortion or be sterilized. Couples failing to comply with China&rsquo;s one-child policy regularly face demotion or loss of jobs, extreme fines, or loss of benefits or access to social services. At times, even homes and personal property have been demolished or confiscated for unpaid fines. Violence against women within families, especially from husbands, is culturally acceptable in some areas of China.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Trafficking of women and children for prostitution or marriage are serious problems in China. Media coverage of this issue is tightly restricted. The one-child policy and a traditional preference for male children have sometimes led to female infanticide and concealment of female births. Unregistered female children have trouble receiving education or medical care. Most children in orphanages are female. Female infants are more likely to be aborted.<br> <b> <br> <font SIZE="3">OUR RESPONSE <br> </b><br> The United Methodist Church calls for greater protection of basic human rights and the creation of democratic liberties in China. We pray for all Chinese, especially for the church in China. In particular, we pray for full religious freedom, a free press, free elections, equal rule of all for all people, and the abolition of torture. We shall be an advocate for human rights and democratic reforms within China in our interactions with the U.S. government and other governments, with ecumenical organizations, and directly with the Chinese government, when possible. We stand in solidarity with human rights advocates and organizations in China.<font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
