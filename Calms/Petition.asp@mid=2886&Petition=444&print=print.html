<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >Amend resolution 309 as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><CENTER><b><font FACE="" SIZE="2" >309.&nbsp;&nbsp;Korea<font FACE="Times New Roman">-Peace, Justice, and Reunification <br> </font></b></b></CENTER></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >....In many ways, the Korean people, north and south, have expressed their strong desire for reunification. Since 1984, there have been official contacts and conversations on economic and humanitarian issues between ROK and DPRK. Emergency assistance by the DPRK and the ROK following devastating floods in the south and floods and drought in the north was offered and accepted by each other. The first government-sponsored exchange of visits between divided family members occurred in 1985. Thousands of overseas Koreans were able to visit their family members in the DPRK. Christians from north and south met in 1986 in Glion, Switzerland, as part of an ecumenical process on peace and the reunification of Korea led by the World Council of Churches. In 1987, both sides offered proposals to lower military tensions on the peninsula. <b><font SIZE="3">In June 2000, an unprecedented historic summit between North and South Korean leaders took place in Pyongyang, DPRK. President Kim Dae Jung and Chairman Kim Jong Il pledged themselves to work toward Korean reunification. Since the summit, both Koreas have had numerous exchanges such as reunions of separated families, ministerial level talks, and other economic, social, cultural and sports exchanges including reconnection of railways and roads through the Demilitarized Zone. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> The relationship between the United States and the DPRK, however, has deteriorated due to the issues related to the DPRK<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">'<font FACE="Times New Roman">s violation of nuclear proliferation since 2001. It has&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </CENTER> turned out that both signatories of the 1994 Agreed Framework have violated the mandates of the agreement. It is most desirable that the United States and the DPRK, through direct negotiations, redraft or update the 1994 Agreement encompassing all vital matters of interest to both sides including DPRK<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">'<font FACE="Times New Roman">s nuclear proliferation issues and U.S. recognition of the sovereignty and security of the DPRK. </b><font SIZE="2">In 1991, the Agreement on Cooperation of Non-aggression and Exchange was adopted; and in 1992, a Non-nuclearization of the Peninsula was signed by both sides. In 1994, the United States and DPRK signed the Agreed Framework in reference to the DPRK nuclear programs and bilateral US-DPRK issues. The agreement stipulated that funds would be provided to the DPRK from the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) for the construction of two light-water electric power reactors. In addition, the U.S. agreed to provide 500,000 tons of heavy oil annually to the DPRK. In return, the DPRK agreed to forego any further accumulation of fuel rods which could be used to produce atomic bombs. The Agreed Framework remains an important stabilizing element in the US-DPRK relations. It is one of the key tools of engagement by which DPRK uses incentives rather than threats to build inter-Korean and regional cooperation.... <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Engage in prayer of penitence .... <br> (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Commend the policy statement .... <br> (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Participate in the ecumenical effort .... <br> (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Urge all governments .... <br> (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Urge all governments involved .... <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="" SIZE="2" >(a) -The peaceful reunification of Korea....&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> (b) -A peace treaty should be signed .... <br> (c) -ROK and DPRK contacts should be encouraged; <br> (d) -Bilateral diplomatic and human contacts between the United States and the DPRK should be enhanced. <br> <strike><font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif">(e) </strike>-<strike><font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif">Upon the ratification of a peace settlement in the Korean peninsula based on the spirit of the peace treaty and the non-aggression pact, and the restoration of mutual trust between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People<font FACE="Times New Roman">&rsquo;<font FACE="Microsoft Sans Serif">s Republic of Korea, U.S. troops in Korea should be withdrawn, and, accordingly, the U.N. command should be dissolved. At the same time, all nuclear weapons in Korea should be removed.
