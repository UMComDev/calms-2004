<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" SIZE="3" ><font COLOR="#000000">Report No. 15 <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT"><br> <b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT"><br> REPORT ON THE 2001-2004 RESEARCH PLAN FOR THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH <br> AND PROPOSED 2005-2008 RESEARCH PLAN <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Mandate <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">The 2000 General Conference approved Calendar Item 1195, endorsing the Research Plan for The United <br> Methodist Church. The purpose of the Research Plan for The United Methodist Church was to provide <br> for a collaborative plan of research and planning on behalf of the general agencies and institutions of The <br> United Methodist Church for the benefit of the entire church. <br> The plan was initiated by the General Council on Ministries (GCOM), on behalf of the Interagency <br> Research Task Force, in accordance with GCOM&rsquo;s Disciplinary responsibilities: <br> <i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT">To facilitate informed decision-making at all levels of the Church by engaging in research and planning <br> in cooperation with the general agencies and the annual conferences. </i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">(�905.4), and <br> <i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT">To give leadership to and participate in planning and research for The United Methodist Church, thereby <br> helping all levels of the Church to evaluate needs, set goals, and plan strategy; to coordinate planning <br> and research for the denomination in cooperation with the general program agencies of The United <br> Methodist Church; and to maintain a list of research and planning documents received from the general <br> program agencies and the annual conferences </i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">(�906.17). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The General Council on Ministries provided funds of approximately $257,000 from its 2001-2004 <br> quadrennial budget and also cared for the staffing needs for this Research Plan. <br> The 2000 General Conference did not approve the additional funding request of $475,000 for this <br> research plan. <br> <b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT"><br> Process and Implementation, 2001-2004 <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">In response to this General Conference action, the GCOM set in motion a consultation between The <br> Office of Research & Planning, and the Interagency Research Task Force. The Interagency Research Task <br> Force emerged during the 1997-2000 quadrennium, as the General Council on Ministries brought together <br> other researchers from throughout the connection to share contacts and ideas. <br> The Office of Research & Planning, GCOM, and the Interagency Research Task Force met throughout <br> the quadrennium, both in person and by conference call, to plan and implement the Research Plan. This <br> planning and implementation focused on the four goals of the Research Plan: <br> 1. The creation of a United Methodist Committee on Research and Planning by calling together <br> researchers from across the denomination on a regular basis to develop and review a model of <br> research and planning for the denomination; coordinate research and determine additional areas for <br> possible research; and coordinate the dissemination of denominational research through various <br> channels and media; <br> 2. The hosting of a United Methodist Forum on the Future by facilitate a gathering of researchers and <br> church leaders by May of 2002 to gather information about the future. Subject matter would be <br> determined by the United Methodist Committee on Research and Planning in light of data gathered at <br> the 2000 General Conference and other sources. <br> 3. The hosting of a United Methodist Central Conference Forum on Research by facilitating a gathering <br> of central conference researchers and church leaders by May of 2003, to be held in a central <br> conference. The forum will be designed in cooperation with central conference researchers. The goal <br> will be to identify research needs in the central conferences, and might also include training in <br> research methods to assist in the development of additional researchers. <br> 4. The continued support of The Office of Research & Planning, GCOM, in its role of research activities <br> that look at the larger picture and broader issues and to facilitate the dissemination of research <br> information being done in other arenas. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> These four goals were met throughout the course of the quadrennium: <br> <font SIZE="3">1. <font SIZE="3">The Interagency Research Task Force met in 2001 and 2002 to share resources and information. A <br> booklet, <i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT">The UMC Research Resource Directory</i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">, has been created highlighting the research services <br> of the various general agencies. Likewise, online resources and links can be found at <font COLOR="#0000ff"><font SIZE="3">www.gcomumc. <br> org/research<font COLOR="#000000">. <br> <font SIZE="3">2. United Methodist Forum on the Future: Lacking funds to host a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; conference of <br> individuals in one location, the Interagency Research Network opted for two Forums on the Future to <br> be broadcast over the Internet. These two Forums, produced in 2003, focused on the theme, &ldquo;What in <br> the World Are We Talking About? Strengthening Our Global Connection and Ecumenical <br> Relationships.&rdquo; Over 1,000 persons logged on to hear the two webcasts. <br> 3. Lack of funding from the 2000 General Conference prevented the hosting of a central conference <br> forum. Nevertheless, representatives from the African central conferences participated in the United <br> Methodist Research Network and presented reports of ongoing work in the central conferences. <br> 4. The Office of Research & Planning, GCOM, continued to provide broad research services through <br> participation in the Faith Communities Today project and the United States Congregational Life <br> Survey. <br> <b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT"><br> Proposed Research Plan, 2005-2008 <br> </b><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">The Research Plan, facilitated by The Office of Research & Planning, GCOM, and the United Methodist <br> Research Network, will <br> 1. Provide leadership to and participate in planning and research for The United Methodist Church, <br> thereby helping all levels of the church to evaluate needs, set goals, and plan strategy; by <br> <i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT">a. Monitoring and tracking denominational trends through national surveys, such projects, as <br> Faith Communities Today; the United States Congregational Life Survey; and National Survey <br> of Leadership in Latino Parishes and Congregations <br> </i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">b. <i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT">Studying the characteristics of the world&rsquo;s population (demographic, economic, religious, and <br> political) and report past, present, and possible future trends. <br> c. Studying the characteristics of the demographics of The United Methodist Church and report <br> past, present, and possible future trends. <br> </i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">2. Coordinate planning and research for the denomination in coordination with the general program <br> agencies of The United Methodist Church; <br> <i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT">a. Cooperating with general agencies to develop planning and research resources to facilitate their <br> mission and ministry; for example, in cooperation with the General Commission on United <br> Methodist Men, a survey of men in The United Methodist Church; in cooperation with the <br> General Commission on the Status and Role of Women, a survey of sexual harassment in The <br> United Methodist Church; and in cooperation with Strengthening the Black Church for the 21<font SIZE="1">st <br> <font SIZE="3">Century and the Interdenominational Theological Center, a survey of black United Methodist <br> churches. <br> b. Continuing to host the United Methodist Research Network <br> c. Continuing to use technology, such as the Forums on the Future, to disseminate information <br> </i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">3. Maintain a list of research and planning documents received from the general program agencies and <br> the annual conferences, by <br> <i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT">Continuing the development of a web site to enable annual conferences around the world to <br> access and download planning, research, evaluation, and coordination resources. <br> </i><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">The General Council on Ministries will care for the continued staffing and funding of this research plan in <br> its quadrennial budget. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Signed: __________________________________ <br> Bishop Edward W.
