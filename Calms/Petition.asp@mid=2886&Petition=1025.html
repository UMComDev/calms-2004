If such person fails to contact the Administrator within 12 months (except as provided in Section 5.17b), such benefit will be forfeited (except as provided in Section 5.17c) and will become the benefit of, in the case of a Participant, Former Participant, or alternate payee (within the meaning of Section 10.04), such person&rsquo;s Beneficiary, or, in the case of a Beneficiary, the Participant&rsquo;s, Former Participant&rsquo;s, or alternate payee&rsquo;s successor Beneficiary (including any default Beneficiaries provided under the terms of the Plan).

If the Participant fails to claim the benefit within the 60-day period, the Participant shall be deemed, in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the Administrator, to have relinquished any benefit that may be payable to the Participant. <br> b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure of a Beneficiary to properly claim a benefit due hereunder during the stated time period, or if no time period is stated, then within two years of being eligible to receive the benefit, shall cause the benefit to be considered to have been refused and forfeited and shall cause the benefit to be paid to the secondary Beneficiary or default Beneficiary in accordance with the Plan. If the last default Beneficiary does not claim the benefit within a two-year period commencing with the date on which he/she became eligible to receive the benefit, the benefit shall be considered to be refused and forfeited by said Beneficiary. After the last two-year period has expired, the Administrator shall send a certified letter with return receipt requested to the last known address of the last default Beneficiary indicating that the Beneficiary has 60 days to claim such benefit. Failure to claim the benefit within the 60-day time period shall cause the benefit to be forfeited. Such forfeited amounts shall be added to the reserves of the Plan.
