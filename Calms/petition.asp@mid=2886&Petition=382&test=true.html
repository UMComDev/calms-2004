<CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Human Rights in Laos <br> </font></b></b><b></CENTER></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> Laos has a one-party dictatorship that denies basic human rights and freedoms to its people. Political, economic, and religious freedom are denied. Opponents of the regime are routinely imprisoned. Torture is common. According to human rights groups, including Amnesty International, prisoners are routinely subjected to kicking, punching, beatings with rods, death threats, simulated executions, solitary incarceration, suffocation, near-drowning, electric shocks, burning, and exposure to severe temperatures. Prison conditions are almost always poor, and malnutrition of prisoners is a serious problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>THE ISSUES <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Freedom of Speech</b> -&nbsp;&nbsp;The government controls or tightly restricts all major institutions in Laos, including the media, schools, religious institutions, and trade unions. The government owns all newspapers and broadcast media and strictly regulates what is presented to the public. Journalists who have refused to cooperate with the government have been sentenced to prison for up to 5 to15 years. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> E-mails and Internet usage are strictly monitored by the government. All political Web sites are therefore blocked. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The government has a large surveillance system, including neighborhood committees, which monitor any possibility of criticism of the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> All trade unions must belong to the government-controlled Federation of Lao Trade Unions. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Free Elections</b> - The Lao Peoples Revolutionary Party, which is communist, is the only legal political party in the country. The party controls the government. The National Assembly serves as a rubber stamp for the Party. Elections are held every five years, but all candidates are approved by the party.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Political Prisoners</b> -&nbsp;&nbsp;Political prisoners are detained for years in Laos because of their opposition to the government. Their arrests, trials, and conditions of imprisonment are enshrouded in secrecy. Some prisoners are known to have served ten years in prison without trial. Members of the Lao Students Movement for Democracy have been imprisoned for calling for human rights, the release of political prisoners, a multi-party political system, and elections of a new National Assembly. Sometimes religious detainees are singled out for abuse, including inadequate food and deprivation of medical care. Pastors have been arrested for holding religious services without government authorization. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Religious Freedom</b> -&nbsp;&nbsp;The Laotian government claims there is religious freedom, but religious activity is tightly restricted, according to human rights organizations. The Lao Front for National Construction, an organ of the communist party, oversees religious practice. Most Laotians are Buddhists. There is a small Roman Catholic minority and also a small but growing Protestant minority. The government encourages Protestants to belong to the Lao Evangelical Church, but the Seventh Day Adventist Church is also recognized.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Laotians are often jailed for offenses such as proselytizing or other peaceful religious activities. Dozens of Christians have recently been detained and others have been banned from worshiping openly or forced to deny their beliefs. Protestant churches are a major target for church closings, arrests of leaders, and forced denials of faith by the police. Some government officials have singled out Christianity as a Western &ldquo;import&rdquo; that is subversive. Many Christians in Laos belong to tribes that are historically resistant to the government, which has contributed to persecution.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Sometimes the celebration of Christian holidays or honoring Sunday as the sabbath is denied or restricted. Distribution of any non-Buddhist religious texts is illegal in Laos. Christians complain it is difficult to obtain Bibles and other devotional materials. Permission is required for church creation or construction. That permission is often denied.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> No religious schools are permitted in Laos except for some instruction in Buddhist temples.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The government tightly controls Buddhist clergy, who are required to study Marxism-Leninism, attend some party meetings, and support government policies. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Foreigners who evangelize in Laos can be arrested and deported immediately. The importation of foreign religious materials is illegal and also can be cause for arrest and deportation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>OUR RESPONSE <br> </b><br> The United Methodist Church calls for the protection of basic human rights and the creation of democratic liberties in Laos. We pray for all Laotians, especially for the church in Laos. In particular, we pray for full religious freedom, a free press, free elections, equal rule of all for all people, and the abolition of torture.&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall be an advocate for human rights and democratic reforms within Laos in our interactions with the U.S. government and other governments, with ecumenical organizations, and directly with the Laotian government, when possible. We stand in solidarity with all in Laos who struggle for freedom and human dignity. <font FACE="Tahoma"><font SIZE="2">
