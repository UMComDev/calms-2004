<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Report No. 10 <br> <font SIZE="4">Audit and Review Committee <br> <font SIZE="3"><br> </font></b></b><b></CENTER></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >Scandal in corporate America is a news story that refuses to die. Not a day passes without the headlines revealing an executive making loose with expense accounts, a stock scheme swindling investors, or someone&rsquo;s life ruined by the unethical behavior of their employer. We can rest easy, smug in the knowledge that no financial folderol could happen in this corner of the Lord&rsquo;s vineyard known as the United Methodist Church. Or could it?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the body of Christ immune from temptation, inefficiency, and incompetence?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In its oversight of fiscal responsibilities, the Committee on Audit and Review uses the framework of internal audits and evaluation tools of the Committee on Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. The COSO is a committee formed by the National Association of CPA&rsquo;s, the American Accounting Association, the Institute of Internal Auditors, the Institute of Management Accountants, and the Financial Executives Institute. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Internal audit is an independent appraisal function established within an organization to assist management in the effective discharge of their responsibilities. COSO defines internal control as a process that is carried out by an entity&rsquo;s board of directors, management, and other personnel to gain reasonable assurance that objectives are achieved in the following areas: <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effectiveness and efficiency of operations. For example, is the entity operating within its financial ability to achieve and support its stated mission? <br> 2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Financial reporting. Are the published financial statements reliable and accurate? Are there off-balance sheet items or grants?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the reporting transparent? <br> 3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compliance with the law and, in our case, <i>The Book of Discipline</i>. What systems are in place to insure compliance? <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >&nbsp;&nbsp;4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safeguarding resources. Are procedures in place to protect against fraud and theft? <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" ><br> The GCFA Audit and Review Committee, its relationship with the external auditor, its internal audit department, and the general boards&rsquo; own audit committees all play an important role in achieving these objectives. COSO created an integrated framework to evaluate an organization&rsquo;s internal control including 1) the control environment, 2) risk assessment, 3) control activities, 4) information and communication, and 5) monitoring.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Since the last quadrennium, the Internal Audit Department (IAD) will have completed over 100 internal audits, spanning all the general agencies. In addition, the committee reviews annually the external audits, management letters, and management&rsquo;s response of all agencies/treasuries - over 140 different audit reports. The committee has reviewed the annual audits of all episcopal areas. It has also reviewed the external audits of all groups funded by the General Conference but not connected to a general agency. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The Audit and Review Committee is pleased to report that from the perspective of internal controls and financial reporting, the conditions of the general agencies of the Church continue to improve. The strength and effectiveness of internal controls has improved in the agencies as has the training, education, and experience of their financial staffs.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> With the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 following corporate accounting scandals, the private sector has had to look anew at its financial reporting standards. Although there are no direct requirements on the church, the spirit of Christian perfection must influence all agencies to go beyond mere legal requirements and best practices. Some agencies have already focused on a few applicable provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley; others are moving in that direction. This means the presidents, general secretaries, and board members must acknowledge and be accountable for their stated missional and fiduciary responsibilities. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The Internal Audit Department has not limited its activities to the general agencies. On three occasions the Internal Audit Department was requested to assist the treasurer&rsquo;s office of annual conferences. To be sure, these involved extraordinary circumstances, but the connection between the IAD and annual conferences was new and beneficial to both. Staff of the Internal Audit Department also worked with several annual conference treasurers&rsquo; offices prior to performing an agency audit. The staff needed to understand more fully the flow of funds from a local church, through an annual conference, to a general agency. As circumstances arise and resources permit, the Internal Audit Department will continue to be open to opportunities of cooperation with annual conferences. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The Internal Audit Department staff has professional credentials, experience, and expertise beyond financial matters. They are highly trained, objective professionals who have more to offer the church. The Audit and Review Committee is grateful to the Internal Audit Department staff for their excellent work and performance, even while operating with fewer staff members because of budget reductions. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >
