<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >Amend Resolution No. 9 as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </font><CENTER><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental Racism<b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> </font></CENTER></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >The United Methodist Church is committed to understanding and eliminating racism. One generally ignored aspect is environmental racism. People of color are disproportionately affected by toxic contamination due to the production, storage, treatment, and disposal process of hazardous materials and wastes. African American, Hispanic North American, Asian American, Native American, and third world communities are usually the least able, politically and economically, to oppose the sitings of these facilities. <br> Research has documented the following: <br> (1) Race is consistently the most statistically significant variable in the location of commercial hazardous waste facilities. Three of the five largest commercial hazardous waste landfills in the United States are located in communities of color; communities with commercial hazardous waste facilities have two to three times the average minority population of communities without such facilities; and three out of every five African Americans and Hispanic North Americans live in communities with toxic waste sites.</sub><sup>1</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;The predominantly African American and Hispanic south side of Chicago has the greatest concentration of hazardous waste sites in the United States. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Communities where hazardous waste incinerators are sited tend to have large minority populations, low incomes, and low property values. The minority portion of the population in communities with existing incinerations is 98 percent higher than the national average. In Houston, Texas, six of eight municipal incinerators are located in predominantly African American neighborhoods.</sub><sup>2</sup></sub><br> (3) Communities of color have greater cancer rates than white communities.</sub><sup>3</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many environmental groups are calling for a study of the linkage between environmental contamination and increased cancer rates. <br> (4) Fifty percent of the children in the United States suffering from lead poisoning are African American. <br> (5) Farm workers&rsquo; children (mainly Hispanics) in the United States suffer a higher rate of birth defects due to their mothers&rsquo; exposure to pesticides during the early stages of pregnancy. In farm worker communities, children with cancer are common. Pesticide exposure among farm workers causes more than 300,000 pesticide-related illnesses each year.</sub><sup>4</sup></sub><br> (6) Navajo teenagers have cancer rates seventeen times the national average, due to countless uranium spills on Navajo lands that contaminated their water, air, and soil.</sub><sup>5</sup></sub><br> (7) The growing trend during the 1980s and 1990s has been to dump toxic wastes in developing countries.</sub><sup>6</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries such as Liberia have been offered much-needed foreign capital if they accepted several shipments of toxic wastes in the past few years. Unfortunately, these countries often lack the appropriate infrastructure to adequately handle the environmental and health problems that accompany these wastes. <br> Other evidence suggests that the problem is worsening. The findings of the Interdenominational Hearings on Toxics and Minorities, held in September 1990, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the General Board of Church and Society-sponsored consultation on Responding to Communities Facing Toxic Hazards held in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in October 1990, poignantly demonstrated that communities <strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">are</strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp; <b><font FACE="Times New Roman">were </b><font FACE="Times New Roman">still having problems related to toxic contamination more than ten years after the media exposed the problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font FACE="Times New Roman">The problem continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazardous waste is still exposed in many communities such as Anniston, Alabama even in the year 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp;The work must continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be persistent and consistent in exposing these atrocities.</b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> Our society&rsquo;s attitude toward the production and disposal of hazardous products is one of &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind.&rdquo; But &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; is most often where the poor and powerless live and work. These communities have thus become toxic &ldquo;sacrifice zones.&rdquo; This pattern of racism represents a serious challenge to the conscience of all Christians. We ask our local churches, conferences, and general agencies to join with other religious bodies and groups in actions to end this form of racism: <br> (1) We request the Council of Bishops to address environmental racism in any formal communication to the denomination concerning racism or the environment. <br> (2) We urge annual conferences, districts, local churches, and general agencies to become more involved with community groups working to alleviate environmental racism. <br> (3) We urge all general program agencies and the General Commission on Religion and Race to: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(a) -disseminate the &ldquo;stories&rdquo; of people and communities affected by environmental racism; <br> (b) -find expertise, build leadership, and develop networks that can help empower people within communities in crisis; and <br> (c) -develop programs that help annual conferences, districts, and local churches respond to these concerns. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(4) We call upon the General Board of Church and Society to: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(a) -advocate a moratorium on the siting of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities in low-income/people-of-color communities; <br> (b) -advocate comprehensive legislation that remedies these injustices and adequately protects all citizens and the environment; and <br> (c) -develop programs that help annual conferences, districts, and local churches respond to these concerns. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(5) We request the General Council on Ministries to assist the General Board of Church and Society in conducting research in this area. <br> (6) <strike><font FACE="Times New Roman">We call upon the General Board of Pension and Health Benefits and other church investors to sponsor shareholder resolutions on environmental racism issues and to urge corporations to sign guidelines for corporate conduct on the environment (such as the Valdez Principles developed in cooperation with the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility). <br> <b></strike> We call upon the General Board of Pension and Health Benefits and other church investors to advocate in dialogue and shareholder resolutions with corporations on environmental racism issues and to urge companies to adopt environmental codes of conduct (such as the CERES Principles and to engage in greater transparency and public reporting modeled after the Global Reporting Initiative). </b><strike> <br> </strike> (7) We urge individual United Methodists to:<strike> <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strike><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(a) -become aware of how and where their community&rsquo;s wastes are disposed and who in their community is adversely affected by the production and disposal of industrial chemicals; and <br> (b) -make a personal commitment to reduce their use of hazardous chemicals by one each day; <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(8) We call upon the U.S. federal government to: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(a) -institute comprehensive risk-assessment studies of communities at risk and their affected populations; <br> (b) -enable these communities to participate in clean-up decisions that affect them directly; <br> (c) -institute a budget and staff in the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor toxic waste siting in low-income/people-of-color communities; <br> (d) -give these communities priority in receiving Superfund funding to clean up existing sites; and <br> (e) -prohibit hazardous waste exports and imports. <br> </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(9) We urge industry to: <br> </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" >(a) -assess the adverse impacts of their production and disposal processes on workers and surrounding communities; <br> (b) -implement comprehensive Toxics Use Reduction (TUR) programs; <br> (c) -develop nontoxic alternatives to commonly used hazardous materials; <br> (d) -comply with local, state, and federal environmental and safety laws; <br> (e) -respond to community concerns and grievances; <br> (f) -sign comprehensive environmental guidelines developed with public input, such as the Valdez Principles; and <br> (g) -develop industrywide standards for environmental accounting and auditing procedures similar to those required for financial accounting. <br> </font><p align="right"><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1" >ADOPTED 1992 <br> </font></p><i><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" ><br> </font></i></i></sub><sup></i><font SIZE="1" FACE="Times New Roman" >1</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Toxic Wastes and Race,&rdquo;
