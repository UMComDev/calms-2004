<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" >WHEREAS, &ldquo;Christian ministry is the expression of the mind and mission of Christ,&rdquo; and &ldquo;All Christians are called through their baptism to this ministry&rdquo; (� 125); the forms of this ministry are as diverse as the gifts and talents with which God has graced each life; and &ldquo;The ministry of all Christians is complementary. No ministry is subservient to another. All United Methodists are summoned and sent by Christ to live and work together in mutual interdependence and to be guided by the Spirit&rdquo; (� 129); and <br> WHEREAS, &ldquo;Within The United Methodist Church, there are those called to servant leadership, lay and ordained,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Such callings are evidenced by special gifts, evidence of God&rsquo;s grace, and promise of usefulness,&rdquo; and &ldquo;God&rsquo;s call to servant leadership is inward as it comes to the individual and outward through the discernment and validation of the Church&rdquo; (� 136); and <br> WHEREAS, the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry, Division of Ministry, in cooperation with other agencies of the church has developed standards and requirements to certify and renew biennially persons in professional ministry careers (�� 1423.7 and 632.2.t); and <br> WHEREAS, the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry, Division of Ministry and the General Board of Discipleship continue to encourage and resource conference boards of ordained ministry, boards of discipleship, and other appropriate bodies for the ongoing recognition and support of persons in professional careers (�� 632.2t and 1102); and <br> WHEREAS, the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry, Division of Ministry works with seminaries, graduate schools, universities, and colleges by providing guidance, standards, and technical support for the academic preparation for professional ministry careers; and <br> WHEREAS, the Discipleship Ministries Unit of the General Board of Discipleship produces training events and resources for continuing leader formation in the church (lay leadership, youth ministry, Christian education, and so forth); <br> Therefore, be it resolved that in order to recognize, authenticate, and celebrate those serving in professional lay ministry on behalf of The United Methodist Church, the 2004 General Conference affirm the following recommendations: <br> 1) The focus for continuing development of persons in professional ministry will be shared by GBHEM and GBOD in cooperation with colleges, universities, seminaries, and annual conferences as partners in the educational and development process. <br> 2) A more cooperative approach among the appropriate general agencies, professional associations, conference boards and leadership, and United Methodist colleges, universities, and seminaries will be developed to provide a variety of educational avenues and resources for lay persons serving in the church who seek to enhance their learning and increase their knowledge and skills to become more effective workers in their area of service on behalf of the church. Such avenues may include continuing education, certification, professional development, degree programs, conference programs, regional programs, and so forth. (For example: A college will partner with an annual conference to develop and implement a certificate program or course of study program to prepare and credential persons for youth ministry, Christian education, and so forth.) <br> 3) General agencies; colleges, universities, and seminaries; and conferences will cooperate to broaden and make more accessible the delivery systems for the education and development of church workers, for example college/<br> university/seminary settings, extension sites, lay academies, other conference settings, regional settings, distance learning, e-learning, conferencing, and so forth. <br> 4) An intentional cooperative approach will be shared by GBHEM and GBOD in consultation with conference leadership to develop and expand resources, methods, and rituals for acknowledgment and authentication by the church for those serving in professional/specialized lay ministry. These acts of recognition and celebration may take place where appropriate, including <br> </font></b></b><b>&nbsp; <li><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&nbsp;recognition ceremonies at annual conference sessions; <br> </ul><li>recognition celebrations where study is completed (either by residence or distance learning)-colleges, universities, seminaries, conference lay academies, and so forth; <br> </ul><li>acknowledgement of professional certification in annual conference journals (� 632.2t); <br> </ul><li>district or local church celebrations.</b><font FACE="Times New Roman"><br> </font></li><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" >&nbsp;
